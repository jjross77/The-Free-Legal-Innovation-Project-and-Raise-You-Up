"slapping" or "roughing up" in his description, "blows" in hers.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">The appellant had left the house for short periods and in September of 1982 the complainant decided to end the affair.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">She told the appellant to leave and he did.</p><p style="background-color: #F5FFFA">3.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">On September 23, 1982, some days after his dismissal, the appellant broke into the house at about 4:30 a.m.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">He was "raging" at her and furious because of his expulsion.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">He terrorized her with a file‐like instrument with which he was armed.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">She was fearful of what might occur, and in order to calm him down she held out some hope of a reconciliation and they had intercourse.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">A report was made to the police of this incident, the complainant asserting she had been raped, but no proceedings were taken.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">The appellant's probation officer became involved and there was evidence that he had asked the complainant not to press the matter, presumably because it would interfere with the appellant's probation.</p><p style="background-color: #F5FFFA">4.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">On October 15, 1982, again at about 4:30 a.m., the appellant broke into the complainant's house through a basement window.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">She was alone, and awakened by the entry she seized the bedroom telephone in an effort to call the police.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">The appellant picked up a butcher knife in the kitchen and came into the bedroom.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">He was furious and violent.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">He accused her of having another boyfriend; pulled the cord of the telephone out of the jack and threw it into the living room; threatened her with the knife and ordered her to take off her nightdress and made her stand in the kitchen doorway, naked save for a jacket over her shoulders, so he could be sure where she was while he repaired the window to conceal his entry from the police, should they arrive.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">He struck her on the mouth with sufficient force to draw blood, and on three occasions rammed the knife blade into the wall with great force, once very close to her.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">He told her that if the police came he would put the knife through her, and added that if he had found her with a boyfriend he would have killed them both.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">At one point he tied her hands behind her back with a scarf.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">The complainant said she was in fear for her life and sanity.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">5.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">By about 5:30 a.m., after an hour of such behaviour by the appellant, she tried to calm him down.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">She pretended again that there was some hope of a reconciliation if the appellant would settle down and get a job.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">This had the desired effect.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">He calmed down and after some conversation he joined her on the bed and they had intercourse.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">The complainant swore that her consent to the intercourse was solely for the purpose of calming him down, to protect herself from further violence.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">This, she said, was something she had learned from earlier experience with him.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">In her evidence she said:   I didn't consent at any time.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">I was very afraid.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">My whole body was trembling.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">I was sure I would have a nervous breakdown.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">I came very, very close to losing my mind.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">All I knew was I had to keep this man calm or he would kill me.</p><p style="background-color: #F5FFFA">6.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">At about 6:45 a.m. after further conversation with the appellant she got dressed and prepared to leave for work.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">She had a business appointment at 8:00 a.m. She drove the appellant to a location which he chose, and in the course of the journey he returned her keys and some money that he had taken from her purse upon his arrival in the early morning.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">Upon dropping him off she drove immediately to her mother's home where she made a complaint of rape.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">The police were called and the appellant was arrested that evening.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">7.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">The appellant was charged with rape, unlawful confinement, robbery, breaking and entering with intent to commit an indictable offence, and possession of a weapon.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">At trial, before her Honour Judge Krindle in the County Court of Winnipeg without a jury, he was acquitted on the charge of rape but was convicted of breaking and entering and unlawful confinement.</p><p style="background-color: #F5FFFA">The Court of Appeal (Matas, Huband and Philp JJ.A.‐‐Philp J.A.</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">dissenting) allowed the Crown's appeal on the charge of rape and entered a conviction as well as imposing a sentence of five years' imprisonment.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The unlawful confinement count was held to be subsumed in the rape.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The appellant appealed to this Court asserting that the defence of mistake of fact, in this case a belief by the appellant that the complainant consented to intercourse, is open to an accused under s. 143(b)(i) of the Criminal Code as well as under para.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">(a), and that it is the honesty of such belief that is determinative in considering the defence, not its reasonableness.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Reliance was placed on Pappajohn v. The Queen, 1980 CanLII 13 (SCC), [1980] 2 S.C.R.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">120.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">8.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The indictment set out the rape count in these terms:   1.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">THAT he, the said John Henry Sansregret, a male person, on or about the fifteenth day of October, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and eighty‐two, at the City of Winnipeg in the Eastern Judicial District in the Province of Manitoba, did unlawfully have sexual intercourse with Terry Wood, a female person who was not his wife, with her consent, which consent was extorted by threats or fear of bodily harm.</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">It clearly falls within s. 143(b)(i) of the Criminal Code.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">On the facts of this case, briefly summarized above, at first glance it may appear strange indeed that defence of mistake of fact could be suggested, let alone made out.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">To appreciate how the issue arises, reference must be made to the findings of fact made at trial (1983), 1983 CanLII 3732 (MB KB), 34 C.R.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">(3d) 162, and to the judgments given in the Court of Appeal (1983), 1983 CanLII 3515 (MB CA), 37 C.R.</p><p style="background-color: #F5FFFA">(3d) 45.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">9.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The trial judge described the complainant as a bright, sophisticated woman, articulate, capable, and well employed.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">She considered that the appellant was neither particularly intelligent nor "verbal" and expressed surprise that any intimate relationship had ever arisen between them.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">She described the events of September 23, 1982, a month before the events in question, and she considered there was no evidence that the appellant knew she had complained of rape as a result of that incident.</p><p style="background-color: #FF00FF">Comment will be made on this question later.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">She then referred to the defence of mistake of fact, and said (at p. 164):   If there were any evidence before me that the accused was aware on 15th October that the complainant had considered the sexual relations of 23rd September 1982 to have been non‐consensual, I would have rejected this defence out of hand.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">There is no such evidence.</p><p style="background-color: #FF00FF">I can speculate, but that is not proof.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">She described in detail the events of October 15 and said that she accepted the complainant's version in so far as it differed from the appellant's, but she observed that in many respects his evidence confirmed hers.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">She continued (at p. 166):                       I am satisfied beyond any doubt, that the accused broke and entered the complainant's residence of 15 October motivated primarily by jealously and I do not doubt for a moment that, had the complainant had a man there, the knife would have been used aggressively.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">Having not found another man, he was bound and determined to make the complainant hear what he had to say to her by confining her unlawfully.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">He certainly broke and entered the dwelling‐house with intent to commit an indictable offence therein, and he certainly took possession of the butcher knife for purposes dangerous to the public peace.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">Having entered the house and discovering that the complainant was on the telephone, being unsure about whether or not she had called the police, two things became paramount.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">One was to cover up the evidence of his break‐in so that it would not be visible from the street, and to cover up his presence in the house by reducing it to darkness.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">The second was to prevent the escape of the complainant, or her use of the telephone, particularly probable events while he was outside putting the basement window back on the house.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">What better way to confine her than to take her car keys, her house keys, her money, to strip her naked, to bind her hands and to force her to stand by the back door and whistle so he could hear where she was.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">I find that the accused forced the complainant to strip and tied her hands, not by way of preliminaries to an intended rape, but by way of confining the complainant.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">I similarly find the forced taking of her keys and money, to be part of the unlawful confinement.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">She said that once the appellant became satisfied that the police would not come, he set out to convince the complainant to reconcile.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">She accepted the evidence of the complainant that she was absolutely terrified, and that her consent was given solely to protect herself from further violence or death.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">She told him the things he wanted to hear regarding reconciliation, and she assured him that no other man was of interest to her.</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">Then the trial judge continued (at pp.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">167‐68):                      As I said, no rational person could have been under any honest mistake of fact.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">However, people have an uncanny ability to blind themselves to much that they do not want to see, and to believe in the existence of facts as they would wish them to be.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">The accused says that, notwithstanding the reign of terror which preceded their chat, notwithstanding that he held a knife while they talked, notwithstanding that he did most of the talking and that the complainant's answers were clearly equivocal, he presumed and believed that everything between them was peachy, this notwithstanding that three weeks earlier, on a replay of the same sort of evening, his probation officer became involved and the complainant moved out of the house.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Very honestly, despite my confidence in the ability of people to blind themselves to reality, and even if the accused had not lied about other parts of his testimony, I would have been hard‐pressed to credit the honesty of his belief.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">However, his honest belief finds support in the testimony of the complainant.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">She knows him, and in her opinion, notwithstanding all the objective facts to the contrary, he did believe that everything was back to normal between them by the time of the sexual encounter.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">His subsequent behaviour as well attests to that fact.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">I do not like the conclusion which this leads me to.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">There was no real consent.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">There was submission as a result of a very real and justifiable fear.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">No one in his right mind could have believed that the complainant's dramatic about‐face stemmed from anything other than fear.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">But the accused did.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">He saw what he wanted to see, heard what he wanted to hear, believed what he wanted to believe.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The facts in Pappajohn v. R., 1980 CanLII 13 (SCC), [1980] 2 S.C.R.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">120,...are quite dissimilar to those in this case.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The dictum of the Supreme Court of Canada, however, is clear and broad and in no way seems to limit itself to the peculiar circumstances of that case.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Perhaps the Crown will appeal this decision to obtain some direction from the Supreme Court on whether it was that court's intention to cover situations where an accused who demonstrates the clarity and shrewdness this accused showed in securing his own safety at the outset can turn around and, because it does not suit his wishes, can go wilfully blind to the obvious shortly thereafter.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">In any event, the ratio of Pappajohn is clear and it leaves me no alternative but to acquit.</p><p style="background-color: #F5FFFA">10.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">To summarize, the trial judge found that the appellant did not enter the house with intent to make a sexual assault on the complainant; that the complainant consented to intercourse only be­cause of the fear engendered by the threats of the appellant and to save herself; and that the appellant honestly believed that the complainant was giving a free and genuine consent to intercourse.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">She found as well that the complainant, who knew the appellant, also believed in the honesty of his belief.</p><p style="background-color: #F5FFFA">11.</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">In the Court of Appeal three judgments were delivered.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Matas J.A., after reviewing the facts and conclusions of the trial judge, concluded his judgment with these words (at p. 53):                      In the case at bar, it was Mr. Sansregret's conduct which terrorized the complainant and brought about her conciliatory response.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">It would be the ultimate in irony if the complainant's successful pretense that she consented, out of a legitimate fear for her life, could be relied on by the accused as a basis for a defence of honest but mistaken belief in consent.</p><p style="background-color: #00FFFF">To paraphrase the words of McIntyre J., in Pappajohn, the notion of the availability of the defence in these circumstances has an air of unreality.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">In my respectful opinion, it is not open to Mr. Sansregret to terrorize his victim, to follow up the terror with sexual intercourse, and to end up by innocently claiming he had an honest belief in his victim's consent.</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">I have concluded that the defence of mistake of fact does not arise in this case.</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">Huband J.A., agreeing in the result, reached his conclusion on a different basis.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">He considered that the mens rea required for rape is the intent to have intercourse with the complainant without consent or while being reckless as to whether she consented or not.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">He found support for this proposition in Pappajohn, in the words of Dickson J.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">(as he then was), and in Director of Public Prosecutions v. Morgan, [1976] A.C. 182, where Lord Hailsham said, at p. 209:   ...if the intention of the accused is to have intercourse nolens volens, that is recklessly and not caring whether the victim be a consenting party or not, that is equivalent on ordinary principles to an intent to do the prohibited act without the consent of the victim.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">and he referred to the words of Lord Simon regarding the proof of rape which must be made by the Crown when he said, at p. 216:    ...an intention to have sexual intercourse with a woman with knowledge that she is not consenting to it (or reckless as to whether or not she is consenting).</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">It was his view that although the defence of mistake of fact could apply to a charge of rape under s. 143(b)(i) of the Criminal Code where consent had been given, its elements required reshaping.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">He said (at p. 55):   But with a case involving consent extorted by threat the honest belief of the accused, to constitute a defence, must relate not to the consent, but to the impact of the threat.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">He then drew attention to the findings of the trial judge regarding the nature of the complainant's consent, and said (at p. 56):                      It avails the accused nothing to now say "But she consented", when the charge is one of consent extorted by threat.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Everyone is agreed that the complainant gave every indication of consent.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">Upon this basis he reached his conclusion, saying that to proceed with sexual intercourse at all‐‐immediately after an extended period designed to render the complainant submissive‐‐constitutes recklessness sufficient to sustain a charge of rape with consent extorted by threats.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">He agreed with Matas J.A.</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">that the Crown's appeal should be allowed and a conviction of rape entered.</p><p style="background-color: #F5FFFA">12.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">Philp J.A.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">dissented.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">He accepted the findings of fact of the trial judge, to the effect that the belief in consent on the part of the appellant was honestly held, and referred to the evidence of the complainant herself which, in his view, lent support to the trial judge's finding.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Relying on Pappajohn for the proposition that an honest belief in consent need not be reasonably based to support a defence on a charge of rape, he would have dismissed the Crown's appeal and confirmed the acquittal on the rape count.</p><p style="background-color: #F5FFFA">13.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Before this Court the appellant contended that he never suspected, and never had cause to suspect, that the consent had been given because of his threats.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">He argued that all the facts and all findings of the trial judge supported this proposition.</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">He denied wilful blindness and recklessness and contended that the Pappajohn case was decisive in his favour.</p><p style="background-color: #F5FFFA">14.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Rape, as defined in s. 143(a) of the Criminal Code, is of course the act of having sexual intercourse without consent.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The issue with which we are concerned arises directly in a charge under para.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">(a).</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">The question will be: Did the accused have an honest belief that the woman gave her consent?</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">It is in this form that the issue arose in Pappajohn, Morgan, and in R. v. Plummer and Brown (1975), 1975 CanLII 1376 (ON CA), 24 C.C.C.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">(2d) 497 (Ont.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">C.A.)</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">While those cases provide authority for the existence of the defence and for its application where the consent is in issue, in my view they do not cover a charge under s. 143(b)(i) where consent is assumed from the outset.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">In other words, the existence of the consent is established and only its nature, that is, whether it was freely given or procured by threats, is in issue.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Where the accused in a case arising under s. 143(b)(i) asserts an honest belief in consent, the honest belief must encompass more than the fact of consent.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">It must include a belief that it has been freely given and not procured by threats.</p><p style="background-color: #00FFFF">I agree in this respect with Huband J.A.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The defence would apply then, subject to what is said later about wilful blindness, in favour of an accused who had an honest belief that the consent was not the result of threats but one freely given.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">15.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The defence of mistake of fact has been said to rest on the proposition that the mistaken belief, honestly held, deprives the accused of the requisite mens rea for the offence.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The question of the mens rea required for a conviction of rape was considered by Dickson J. in this Court in Pappajohn.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">He reviewed the authorities which have dealt with this question in the English, Australian, and Canadian courts.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">It is not necessary here to refer again to the many authorities considered, but their effect and the conclusions drawn from them by Dickson J. may be summarized.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">He observed, at p. 140, that: "The actus reus of rape is complete upon (a) an act of sexual intercourse; (b) without consent".</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">Under s. 143(b)(i) I would substitute: "(b) with consent if it is extorted by threats of fear of bodily harm".</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">He then raised the consideration of whether at common law and under s. 143 of the Criminal Code the guilty intention for rape extends to the element of consent.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">He concluded that it did, and he said, at p. 145:                      It will thus be seen that the great weight of authority is in support of the view that the accused's perception of the woman's consent is an important aspect of any prosecution for the crime of rape.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">And concluding upon this point, at p. 146, he said:                      In summary, intention or recklessness must be proved in relation to all elements of the offence, including absence of consent.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">This simply extends to rape the same general order of intention as in other crimes.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">I would conclude then that the mens rea for rape under s. 143(a) of the Code must involve knowledge that the woman is not consenting, or recklessness as to whether she is consenting or not, and for s. 143(b)(i), knowledge that the consent was given because of threats or fear of bodily harm, or recklessness as to its nature.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">It would follow, as has been held by the majority of this Court in Pappajohn, that an honest belief on the part of the accused, even though unreasonably held, that the woman was consenting to intercourse freely and voluntarily and not because of threats, would negate the mens rea under s. 143(b)(i) of the Code and entitle the accused to an acquittal.</p><p style="background-color: #F5FFFA">16.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The concept of recklessness as a basis for criminal liability has been the subject of much discussion.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Negligence, the failure to take reasonable care, is a creature of the civil law and is not generally a concept having a place in determining criminal liability.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Nevertheless, it is frequently confused with recklessness in the criminal sense and care should be taken to separate the two concepts.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Negligence is tested by the objective standard of the reasonable man.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">A departure from his accustomed sober behaviour by an act or omission which reveals less than reasonable care will involve liability at civil law but forms no basis for the imposition of criminal penalties.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">In accordance with well‐established principles for the determination of criminal liability, recklessness, to form a part of the criminal mens rea, must have an element of the subjective.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">It is found in the attitude of one who, aware that there is danger that his conduct could bring about the result prohibited by the criminal law, nevertheless persists, despite the risk.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">It is, in other words, the conduct of one who sees the risk and who takes the chance.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">It is in this sense that the term `recklessness' is used in the criminal law and it is clearly distinct from the concept of civil negligence.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">17.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">On the face of it, one would have thought that a man who intimidates and threatens a woman and thereafter obtains her consent to intercourse would know that the consent was obtained as a result of the threats.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">If specific knowledge of the nature of the consent was not attributable to him in such circumstances, then one would think that at the very least recklessness would be.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">It might be said then that this case could have been disposed of on the basis of recklessness.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The trial judge, however, did not do so because of her application of the `mistake of fact' defence.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">18.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">There was indeed an abundance of evidence before the trial judge upon which a finding of recklessness could have been made.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">After a stormy period of cohabitation, the complainant dismissed the appellant from her house in September, 1982 thus demonstrating her rejection of him.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">He broke into the house on September 23 and there went through a performance which led to an act of intercourse with a consent given by the complainant out of fear for her life.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">This incident led to a report to the police and the involvement of the appellant's probation officer.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">In the early morning hours of October 15 he again broke into the house and repeated his earlier performance, which provided the basis for the present charges.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">19.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">There was also evidence from which the clear inference can be drawn that the appellant knew a complaint of rape had been made in respect of the first incident.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">Though the complainant complained to the police about that incident, no charges were laid.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">She was persuaded not to pursue the matter by the appellant's probation officer, who had approached her and told her that he would find a job for Sansregret if she did not press the charges.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">A police officer testified as to a conversation which occurred between himself and Sansregret after the latter's arrest.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">In response to a question as to why he ran from the police when they approached him on the evening of October 16, the appellant replied: "From before, that time she `phoned the police on me before."</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">This reply was confirmed by Sansregret on direct examination but then denied on cross‐examination.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">Sansregret admitted that he knew his probation officer had called the complainant with respect to the September incident and that he knew that he was not welcome in her house.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">There was then evidence that the appellant knew of her attitude towards him; knew that she had complained to the police with respect to the September 23 incident; and knew that it was only the intervention of his parole officer which prevented charges from being laid after that incident.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">I therefore disagree with the trial judge who, in my opinion, was in error in not drawing the inference that the appellant knew that the complainant had complained of rape as a result of the incident on September 23.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">20.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">It is evident that the trial judge would have convicted the appellant of rape had it not been for the defence of mistake of fact.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">She considered that the belief in the consent expressed by the appellant was an honest one and therefore on the basis of Pappajohn, even if it were unreasonably held, as it is clear she thought it was, he was entitled to his acquittal.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">This application of the defence of mistake of fact would be supportable were it not for the fact that the trial judge found in addition that the appellant had been wilfully blind to reality in his behaviour on October 15.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Such a finding would preclude the application of the defence and lead to a different result.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">It is my opinion then that the trial judge erred in this matter in that though she made the requisite findings of fact that the appellant was wilfully blind to the consequences of his acts she did not apply them according to law.</p><p style="background-color: #F5FFFA">21.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The idea of wilful blindness in circumstances such as this has been said to be an aspect of recklessness.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">While this may well be true, it is wise to keep the two concepts separate because they result from different mental attitudes and lead to different legal results.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">A finding of recklessness in this case could not override the defence of mistake of fact.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The appellant asserts an honest belief that the consent of the complainant was not caused by fear and threats.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The trial judge found that such an honest belief existed.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">In the facts of this case, because of the reckless conduct of the appellant, it could not be said that such a belief was reasonable but, as held in Pappajohn, the mere honesty of the belief will support the `mistake of fact' defence, even where it is unreasonable.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">On the other hand, a finding of wilful blindness as to the very facts about which the honest belief is now asserted would leave no room for the application of the defence because, where wilful blindness is shown, the law presumes knowledge on the part of the accused, in this case knowledge that the consent had been induced by threats.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">22.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">Wilful blindness is distinct from recklessness because, while recklessness involves knowledge of a danger or risk and persistence in a course of conduct which creates a risk that the prohibited result will occur, wilful blindness arises where a person who has become aware of the need for some inquiry declines to make the inquiry because he does not wish to know the truth.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">He would prefer to remain ignorant.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The culpability in recklessness is justified by consciousness of the risk and by proceeding in the face of it, while in wilful blindness it is justified by the accused's fault in deliberately failing to inquire when he knows there is reason for inquiry.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Cases such as R. v.

that if he did not know, because he did not want to know, he was within his rights and owed no duty to the belligerents to inform himself; and that the Zamora is condemned contrary to the passage above cited from The Hakan, [1918] A.C. 148, upon a legal presumption arising solely and arbitrarily from the fact that the whole cargo was contraband.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">It may be that in his anxiety not to state more than he found against Mr. Banck, the learned President appeared to state something less, but there are two senses in which a man is said not to know something because he does not want to know it.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">A thing may be troublesome to learn, and the knowledge of it, when acquired, may be uninteresting or distasteful.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">To refuse to know any more about the subject or anything at all is then a wilful but a real ignorance.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">On the other hand, a man is said not to know because he does not want to know, where the substance of the thing is borne in upon his mind with a conviction that full details or precise proofs may be dangerous, because they may embarrass his denials or compromise his protests.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">In such a case he flatters himself that where ignorance is safe, `tis folly to be wise, but there he is wrong, for he has been put upon notice and his further ignorance, even though actual and complete, is a mere affectation and disguise.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Glanville Williams, however, warns that the rule of deliberate blindness has its dangers and is of narrow application.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">He says, at p. 159:                      The rule that wilful blindness is equivalent to knowledge is essential, and is found throughout the criminal law.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">It is, at the same time, an unstable rule, because judges are apt to forget its very limited scope.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">A court can properly find wilful blindness only where it can almost be said that the defendant actually knew.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">He suspected the fact; he realized its probability; but he refrained from obtaining the final confirmation because he wanted in the event to be able to deny knowledge.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">This, and this alone, is wilful blindness.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">It requires in effect a finding that the defendant entended to cheat the administration of justice.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Any wider definition would make the doctrine of wilful blindness indistinguishable from the civil doctrine of negligence in not obtaining knowledge.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">This subject is also dealt with by Professor Stuart in Canadian Criminal Law, 1982, at pp.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">130 et seq., where its relationship to recklessness is discussed.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">23.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">This case reveals, in my view, an appropriate set of circumstances for the application of the `wilful blindness' rule.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">I have outlined the circumstances which form the background.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">I have referred to the findings of the trial judge that the appellant blinded himself to the obvious and made no inquiry as to the nature of the consent which was given.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">If the evidence before the Court was limited to the events of October 15, it would be difficult indeed to infer wilful blindness.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">To attribute criminal liability on the basis of this one incident would come close to applying a constructive test to the effect that he should have known she was consenting out of fear.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The position, however, is changed when the evidence reveals the earlier episode and the complaint of rape which it caused, knowledge of which, as I have said, had clearly reached the accused.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Considering the whole of the evidence then, no constructive test of knowledge is required.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The appellant was aware of the likelihood of the complainant's reaction to his threats.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">To proceed with intercourse in such circumstances constitutes, in my view, self‐deception to the point of wilful blindness.</p><p style="background-color: #F5FFFA">24.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">In my view, it was error on the part of the trial judge to give effect to the `mistake of fact' defence in these circumstances where she had found that the complainant consented out of fear and the appellant was wilfully blind to the existing circumstances, seeing only what he wished to see.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Where the accused is deliberately ignorant as a result of blinding himself to reality the law presumes knowledge, in this case knowledge of the nature of the consent.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">There was therefore no room for the operation of this defence.</p><p style="background-color: #F5FFFA">25.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">This is not to be taken as a retreat from the position taken in Pappajohn that the honest belief need not be reasonable.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">It is not to be thought that any time an accused forms an honest though unreasonable belief he will be deprived of the defence of mistake of fact.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">This case rests on a different proposition.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Having wilfully blinded himself to the facts before him, the fact that an accused may be enabled to preserve what could be called an honest belief, in the sense that he has no specific knowledge to the contrary, will not afford a defence because, where the accused becomes deliberately blind to the existing facts, he is fixed by law with actual knowledge and his belief in another state of facts is irrelevant.</p><p style="background-color: #F5FFFA">26.</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">I would dismiss the appeal.</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">Appeal dismissed.</p><p style="background-color: #F5FFFA">Solicitors for the appellant: Walsh, Micay and Company, Winnipeg.</p><p style="background-color: #F5FFFA">Solicitor for the respondent: Department of the Attorney‐General for the Province of Manitoba, Winnipeg.</p><p style="background-color: #F5FFFA">Back to top              ABOUT</p><p style="background-color: #F5FFFA">        2001 SCC 70 (CanLII) | R. v.

estate promoters and construction workers, were charged with hiring employees who did not have the required competency certificates to work on a construction project or with working in the industry without the proper competency certificates, contrary to s. 119.1 of the Quebec Act Respecting Labour Relations, Vocational Training and Manpower Management in the Construction Industry (the “Construction Act”).</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">The appellants asserted that workers could not obtain the proper competency certificates without becoming members of one of the union groups listed in s. 28 of the Construction Act.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">They claimed that this obligation was unconstitutional because it breached the right not to associate which, in their opinion, was a component of the guarantee of freedom of association in s. 2(d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">At the time, s. 28 of the Construction Act provided that the five union groups listed were the only groups entitled to an assessment of their representativeness.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">Under s. 30, the Commission de la construction du Québec draws up a list of construction workers qualified to take part in a mandatory vote under s. 32, during which each worker must opt for one of the union groups as his or her bargaining representative.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">In order to take part in that vote, a construction worker must hold a journeyman competency certificate, an occupation competency certificate or an apprentice competency certificate.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">Construction workers must also have worked 300 hours in the industry in the 15 months before the election is held.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">On the basis of the vote, the Commission determines the representativeness of every association under s. 35.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">This degree of representativeness determines the extent of the influence of each association in the negotiation process.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">Only a union or a group of

of representativeness does not reach at least 15 percent, it is even deprived of the right to attend collective bargaining sessions.</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">The trial judge dismissed the constitutional argument and found the appellants guilty as charged.</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">The Superior Court affirmed that judgment.</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">The Court of Appeal dismissed the appellants’ motion for leave to appeal to that court.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">Held (McLachlin C.J.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">and Major,

stated.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">As appears from the legislation challenged, the conditions governing the issuance of competency certificates and union membership are closely linked.</p><p style="background-color: #00FF00">A successful challenge to the provisions governing the compulsory choice of a collective bargaining agent might give rise to some defence to the specific charges laid in this case.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Moreover, at the present stage of the proceedings, the interest of justice favours a careful consideration of the substantive issues brought before this Court.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Although the right of association represents a social phenomenon involving the linking together of a number of persons, it belongs first to the individual.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">It fosters one’s self-fulfilment by allowing one to develop one’s qualities as a social being.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The act of engaging in legal activities, in conjunction with others, receives constitutional protection.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">The focus of the analysis remains on the individual, not on the group.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">While the majority of the Court acknowledged  in Lavigne that there was a negative right not to associate, it also accepted a democratic rationale for putting internal limits on it.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">An approach that fails to read in some inner limits and restrictions on a right not to associate would deny the individual the benefits arising from an association.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The acknowledgement of a negative right not to associate would not justify a finding of an infringement of the guarantee whenever a form of compelled association arises.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Some forms of compelled association in the workplace might be compatible with Charter values and the guarantee of freedom of association.</p><p style="background-color: #FF00FF">An inquiry must take place into the nature of the commitment to an association.</p><p style="background-color: #00FF00">In the case of a legislated form of union security, the nature of the legislative scheme must also be closely scrutinized.</p><p style="background-color: #00FF00">The appellants have not made out a case that the challenged legislation establishes a form of ideological conformity that would trigger the application of s. 2(d) of the Charter.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">As it stands, the law does not impose on construction workers much more than the bare obligation to belong to a union.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Their obligation boils down to the obligation to designate a collective bargaining representative, to belong to it for a given period of time, and to pay union dues.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">They may not set up or operate an office or union hall.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">No discrimination is allowed against the members of different unions.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Provided they hold the required competency certificates, all workers are entitled to work in the construction industry without regard to their particular union affiliation.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Section 96 grants members clear rights of information and participation in union life.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The law allows any construction worker to change his or her union affiliation, at the appropriate time.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">There is simply no evidence to support judicial notice of Quebec unions ideologically coercing their members.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Such an inference presumes that unions hold a single ideology and impose it on their rank and file, including the complainants in this case.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Such an inference would amount to little more than an unsubstantiated stereotype.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">The appellants presented no evidence that the legislation imposes a form of ideological conformity or threatens a liberty interest protected by the Charter, which is necessary for it to infringe the right not to associate under s. 2(d).</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">The evidence does not even indicate whether unions are engaged in causes and activities that the appellants disapprove of.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">This is not a subject where judicial knowledge could and should replace proper evidentiary records unless the fact of joining a union were, of itself, evidence of a particular ideological bent.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The well-known fact of trade union participation in public life in Canada does not demonstrate that every union worker joining a union under a union security arrangement should be considered prima facie a victim of a breach of the Charter.</p><p style="background-color: #FF00FF">The question at stake in this appeal should be left to the political process.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Such a solution retains a balance in the application of the Charter, and leaves the legal management of labour relations to Parliament and legislatures as well as to the parties to labour agreements.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The management of labour relations requires a delicate exercise in reconciling conflicting values and interests.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The relevant political, social and economic considerations lie largely beyond the area of expertise of courts.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">This limited and prudent approach to court interventions in the field of labour relations  reflects a proper understanding of the functions of courts and legislatures.</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">In the application of the Charter, it also avoids characterizing any kind of governmental action in support of human rights as a  prima facie infringement of the Charter that would have to be justified under s. 1.</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">Even if the legislation had infringed the s. 2(d) right not to associate, it would still be justified under s. 1 of the Charter.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Legislatures are entitled to a substantial, though not absolute, degree of latitude and deference to settle social and economic policy issues.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Courts should be mindful to avoid second-guessing legislatures on controversial and complex political choices.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The jurisprudence acknowledges that legislative policy-making in the domain of labour relations is better left to the political process, as a general rule.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The limits at issue here are prescribed by law.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The law also addresses a pressing and substantial purpose.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">The history of the legislation demonstrates that the Quebec National Assembly tried to address problems that had become a pressing social and economic issue, which led to a process of trial and error that lasted for several years, and is still going on.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">Moreover, a rational connection existed between the means chosen by the legislature and their goal.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The voting procedure constituted the fairest and most effective way to determine the representativeness of unions.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The obligation to join them demonstrated the will to involve workers in the management of their association, to foster and increase their participation in union life and in union decisions, after a period when democratic values had often been flouted by local unions.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The legislature viewed this form of security as a better instrument to maintain and develop democracy than the Rand formula, under which workers pay for services and have no say on the most important issues concerning the association and its members.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">As it still does, the construction industry played a major role in the economy and development of the province.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">Its labour relations were constantly in turmoil for several years.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">Union democracy was in peril.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">It had become difficult to set up a workable system of collective bargaining.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">A resolution of these difficulties involved both the establishment of the representative status of labour unions and the safeguarding of union democracy.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">The National Assembly sought, in this way, to address the objective of establishing peace and economic efficiency in the industry.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Given the nature of these difficulties, the provisions involving the selection of a bargaining representative, the obligation to choose among a limited number of union groups and compulsory financial support were related to this objective.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">They attempted to create a workable mechanism to establish the representativeness of unions while safeguarding union pluralism.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">There is no evidence that any active employee association in the industry was left out of the process.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">On the contrary, the legislature usually tried to take into account the numerous changes in the organization of the labour groups.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">In this manner, these measures directly aim to further important social and economic purposes.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Viewed in the context of the particular historical experience of Quebec’s labour relations, the legislation also meets the minimal impairment test.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">This limited form of compelled association respects fundamental democratic values.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">It requires only a limited commitment from construction employees.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">They must choose a collective bargaining agent.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">The legislation gives them a choice among five union groups.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">It appears that no new group has been left out of the process.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">The law also calls upon construction employers to support the chosen approach.</p><p style="background-color: #FF00FF">Nothing more is imposed by the law.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Finally, the advantages of the legislation clearly outweigh their limited impact upon the asserted negative right not to associate.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The Construction Act imposes strict obligations on unions in respect of internal democracy.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Any form of employment discrimination is also forbidden.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">The whole process of hiring has been entirely removed from union control by legislation.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">Through a difficult process of legislative experimentation, the legislation has reestablished a degree of peace and union democracy in the Quebec construction industry.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The Court is called upon to consider the validity of a complex legislative scheme, born out of a history of attempts, failures and disappointments.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">At the time the present litigation started, this legislation presented the result of about 30 years of legislative work to create a proper system of collective bargaining in the industry.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">A considerable degree of deference is due to the legislature and the difficulties inherent in the art of government in such a traditionally fractious environment.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Court intervention might affect sensitive aspects of a carefully balanced scheme and is not warranted in the circumstances of this case.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">Per L’Heureux-Dubé J.:  LeBel J.’s extensive review of the troubled history of labour relations in the Quebec construction industry and of the legislative history of the Construction Act was agreed with, as was his conclusion that the Act is constitutional.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">For the reasons given by Wilson J. in Lavigne, however, s. 2(d) of the Charter includes only the positive freedom to associate.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The alleged protected “right not to associate” is nowhere articulated in the Charter, and is antithetical to the purpose and scope of the protected right of association.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The identification of several applicable provincial heads of power should be the end of the matter, since all such heads of power are, by the terms of ss.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">92 and 92A(1), matters over which the provincial legislatures may exclusively make laws.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">By the terms of s. 91, the POGG power applies only in relation to matters not coming within the classes of subjects assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">This exclusivity of provincial jurisdiction over matters falling under s. 92 is fundamental to the Canadian brand of federalism, and was a unique and deliberate choice by the makers of the Constitution who were concerned about federal overreach via the POGG power.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The federal law‐making authority for the peace, order, and good government of Canada was intended to be subject to the division of powers.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Within their areas of legislative authority, provinces are not only sovereign, but exclusively so.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The Act’s entire scheme is premised on the provinces having jurisdiction to do precisely what Parliament has presumed to do in the Act ⸺ it operates only where provincial legislative authority is not exercised, or not exercised in a manner acceptable to the federal Cabinet.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The Act’s backstop model is therefore constitutionally impossible: if the provinces have jurisdiction to do what the Act does, then the Act cannot be constitutional under the national concern branch of POGG.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">This demonstrates that Parliament has legislated in respect of a matter that falls within provincial legislative authority.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Even so, given the majority’s acceptance that some aspect of the Act is truly and distinctly national in scope and lies outside provincial jurisdiction, the question of whether the matter said to be of national concern satisfies the requirements stated in Crown Zellerbach must be considered.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The POGG jurisprudence offers little guidance on the question of whether the pith and substance of the impugned legislation can or should be coextensive with the matter of national concern, or whether the matter of national concern can or should be broader than the pith and substance of the legislation.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">It would be unprecedented and undesirable to accept that the matter of national concern must always be the same as the pith and substance of the statute under review, which can include legislative means, because this would effectively confine Parliament to that particular legislative means in responding to the matter of national concern.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">It is not possible for a matter formerly under provincial jurisdiction to be transformed, when minimum national standards are invoked, into a matter of national concern.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">To accept that allocating national targets or minimum national standards can serve as a basis for recognizing that some aspect of an area of provincial jurisdiction is distinctly national in scope, and therefore lies outside provincial jurisdiction, would be to accept a model of supervisory federalism by which the provinces can exercise their jurisdiction only as long as they do so in a manner that the federal legislation authorizes.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">This would open up any area of provincial jurisdiction to unconstitutional federal intrusion once Parliament decides to legislate uniform treatment.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">In this case, a broad characterization of the national concern is unavoidable in order to encompass the pith and substance of both Part 1 and Part 2.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The matter said to be of national concern can therefore be identified as the purpose of the Act as a whole: the reduction of GHG emissions.</p><p style="background-color: #00FF00">This matter does not meet the requirements of Crown Zellerbach for a valid national concern: it fails to meet the requirements of singleness and indivisibility.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The fact that harms may cross borders is not enough to make out indivisibility.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The matter is divisible because GHGs emissions can be connected to the source province.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Responsibility for the reduction of GHG emissions among the provinces can therefore be readily identified for regulation at the source of the emissions.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">Nationwide GHG emissions are nothing more than the sum of provincial and territorial GHG emissions.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The reduction of GHG emissions therefore lacks the degree of unity required to qualify as an indivisible matter of national concern.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">While a provincial failure to deal effectively with the control or regulation of GHG emissions may cause more emissions from that province to cross provincial boundaries, that is insufficient to meet the requirement of indivisibility in Crown Zellerbach.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Even if each of the pith and substance of Parts 1 and 2 as proposed matters of national concern are considered on their own, the pith and substance of each part is not distinct from matters falling under provincial jurisdiction under s. 92; they therefore do not meet the requirements of Crown Zellerbach.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The reduction of GHG emissions (whether by raising the cost of fuel, or by pricing emissions in a manner that distinguishes among industries based on emissions intensity and trade exposure) does not have the requisite distinctiveness to be recognized as a matter of national concern because the Act encourages provinces to enact substantially the same scheme to serve the same regulatory purpose.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The provinces clearly have jurisdiction to establish standards of GHG price stringency in the province.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The double aspect doctrine has no application in this case.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">While this doctrine allows for the concurrent application of both federal and provincial legislation, it does not create concurrent jurisdiction.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The Act purports to do exactly what the provinces can do, and for precisely the same reason.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">There are simply no distinctly federal aspects of the reduction of GHG emissions that cannot be divided among the enumerated heads of power.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The imposition of minimum national standards cannot be described as the distinctly federal aspect of the matter.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Even were the reduction of GHG emissions a single and indivisible area of jurisdiction, its impact on provincial jurisdiction would be of a scale that is irreconcilable with the division of powers.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Because the power to legislate to reduce GHG emissions effectively authorizes an array of regulations and extends to the regulation of any activity that requires carbon-based fuel, it has the potential to undo Canada’s division of powers.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">GHG emissions simply cannot be treated as a single regulatory matter.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">While the Act does not forbid any activity, the charges it imposes will affect the cost of fuel and dictate the viability of emissions-intensive trade-exposed activities.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">These charges thereby stand to have a profound effect on provincial jurisdiction and the division of powers.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The division of powers analysis allows no recourse to balancing or proportionality considerations.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The Constitution Act, 1867, sets out spheres of exclusive jurisdiction so that within their sphere of jurisdiction, the provincial legislatures are sovereign, which sovereignty connotes provincial power to act or not act as they see fit, not as long as they do so in a manner that finds approval at the federal Cabinet table.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The delegation granted by the Act to the Cabinet is breathtakingly broad.</p><p style="background-color: #FF00FF">The negative right does not sit well with the structure of the Charter.</p><p style="background-color: #00FFFF">Moreover, it would trivialize the Charter since the recognition of such a right would have serious consequences, which would oblige the courts to adopt severe limitations to differentiate between genuine and constitutionally insignificant violations of s. 2(d).</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">While no one should be forced to associate, s. 2(d) of the Charter does not offer such constitutional protection.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Rather, and particularly on the narrowly circumscribed definition of that right and numerous built-in exceptions adopted by LeBel J., the constitutional guarantee of freedom of expression under s. 2(b) will come into play if and when one is forced to associate, as well as possibly s. 7 of the Charter.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Negative rights are viewed as individual rights embodying individual goals:  an individual is given the constitutional right not to belong to an association.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">If the fundamental purpose of freedom of association is to permit the collective pursuit of common goals, then the very concept of a “negative freedom of association” becomes suspect.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The collective pursuit of “common goals” in such a context leads to an abstraction which is difficult to justify.</p><p style="background-color: #FF00FF">The course of judicial restraint suggests that no new constitutional doctrine should be developed if existing doctrine could resolve the issue.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Constitutional remedies are powerful tools which ought to be used with prudence.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">When required, however, they should be applied with vigour and in a purposive manner.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">An additional reason for caution is based on the fact that the impetus for efforts to establish the negative right to association has historically originated with those opposed to the establishment or maintenance of labour associations.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The creation and application of new judicial tools, featuring a questionable mark of origin, will inevitably generate new jurisprudence to which there are certain risks attached.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Such a development may not be viewed as prudent, especially in light of the fact that there is no need to take such a risk because proven alternatives are available.</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">Per Iacobucci J.:  The freedom of association guaranteed by s. 2(d) of the Charter encompasses a negative right to be free from compelled association, which is infringed by the legislation at issue here.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">An analysis that construes the negative freedom within s. 2(d) more broadly than the “ideological conformity” test should be adopted.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">Where the state obliges an association of individuals whose affiliation is already compelled by the facts of life (such as in the workplace), and the association serves the common good or furthers the collective social welfare, s. 2(d) will not be violated unless the forced association imposes a danger to a specific liberty interest.</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">The state-imposed association established by the Construction Act does not promote the common good or further the collective social welfare within the context of s. 2(d) of the Charter.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The legislation fails to provide any justification for the compelled union association that it envisages for Quebec’s construction industry.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Membership in union groups is not contingent upon any competency requirements and there is thus no public assurance that workers within these groups will have the necessary skills and abilities to carry out their trade.</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">Furthermore, the provisions of this legislation impair the appellants’ liberty interests.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The present appeal involves construction workers in Quebec who have no choice but to unionize in order to carry out their work.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">Their liberty is further restricted by the fact that they must become members of one of five union groups that have been specifically accepted by the state.</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">However, the legislation is justified under s. 1 of the Charter.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The Construction Act was adopted within a unique and complex historical context, and served to promote distinct social and economic objectives that were, and remain, pressing and substantial.</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">Further, for the reasons given by LeBel J., the legislation is rationally connected to these objectives, it minimally impairs the freedoms guaranteed under s. 2(d), and its benefits outweigh its deleterious effects.</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">Per McLachlin C.J.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">and Major, Bastarache and Binnie JJ.</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">(dissenting):  Section 2(d) of the Charter implies a negative right not to associate.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The test for an infringement of this right, however, is not whether there is evidence of ideological coercion or conformity imposed by the forced association.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">For ideological conformity to exist, it is not necessary that there be evidence of an imposition of union values or opinions on the member, evidence of a limitation of the member’s free expression, or evidence that the union participates in causes and activities of which the member disapproves.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The interpretation of ideological conformity must be broader and take place in context.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">In this case, this context would take into account the true nature of unions as participatory bodies holding political and economic roles in society which, in turn, translates into the existence of ideological positions.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">To mandate that an individual adhere to such a union is ideological conformity.</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">The challenged statutory provisions infringe the negative right which forms part of s. 2(d).</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">Under the Construction Act, membership in one of the unions is obligatory.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Furthermore, membership has meaning.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Membership is about sharing values, joining to pursue goals in common, expressing views reflecting the position of a particular group in society.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">It is because of the collective force produced by membership that unions can be a potent force in public debate, that they can influence Parliament and the legislatures in their functions, that they can bargain effectively.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">This force must be constituted democratically to conform to s. 2(d).</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">It is not necessary to have more independent evidence of the ideological views of the specific unions involved in this case.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">It is in fact sufficient that adherence is required to a scheme advocating state-imposed compulsory membership which affects freedom of conscience and expression, as well as liberty and mobility interests, for it to have a negative impact on the right to work, because such adherence itself is a form of ideological coercion.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Ideological constraint exists in particular where membership numbers are used to promote ideological agendas and this is so even where there is no evidence that the union is coercing its members to believe in what it promotes.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">In this case, workers objected to being forced to join a union and objected generally to the compulsory unionization scheme, which is ideological in nature.</p><p style="background-color: #00FFFF">This is a case where the freedom not to associate is markedly infringed.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">It is a clear situation of government coercion, the result of which mandates that workers in the construction industry in Quebec group together in a few unions which are specified and approved by government.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The fact that there are five unions from which workers can choose in no way negates this infringement for it remains government-mandated group affiliation.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Self-realization of the worker is violated in many ways.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">He or she must unionize.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Within the prescribed regime, democracy is further restricted by limited choice.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">There is no guarantee that a majority of voters will exercise their right.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">A default provision can determine the outcome of elections.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Those voting for minority associations may be left out of future negotiations.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">When freedom not to associate is considered in light of other Charter values, including liberty, freedom of conscience and expression, mobility and the right to work, it must be concluded that governmental mandatory union association infringes this important Charter right.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Ideological conformity is engaged in particular because the members of the associations necessarily participate in and indirectly support a system of forced association and state control over work opportunity.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">This is a situation whereby the democratic rights of workers are taken away.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Being forced to accept and participate in a system that severely limits the democratic principle in the area of labour relations is a form of coercion that cannot be segregated totally from ideological conformity.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">There is also a breach of the positive right to associate.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">There are severe restrictions on the right of a person to join one of the five chosen unions in order to work in the construction industry in Quebec.</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">Even if the conditions imposed by s. 30 of the Construction Act were permissible limitations on freedom of association, the regional quotas would still need to be justified under s. 1.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">They unduly infringe the ability of workers to join a union, which is a prerequisite for working in the construction industry in Quebec.</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">As such, they are an infringement of the s. 2(d) freedom of association.</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">The infringement of s. 2(d) is not justifiable.</p><p style="background-color: #00FF00">In determining whether this infringement can be justified by s. 1, this Court must again take into consideration Charter values including liberty, freedom of expression, the right to work and mobility rights.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">While it is in the public interest to have structured collective bargaining and to provide for competency requirements, and these are no doubt pressing and substantial objectives, they are not the true objectives of the impugned provisions.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The legislation brings into play restrictions on the admission to the industry, cancellation of the ability to have a non-unionized business, restrictions on bargaining rights, imposition of regional quotas and impingement of regional mobility.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">It has not been demonstrated that there is a logical relationship between the legislation’s stated objectives and these restrictions.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Any justification based on competency is untenable.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The actual requirements of s. 30 and the regional quotas have little if anything to do with the professional competence of workers in the construction industry.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Being a resident of Quebec in the previous year, having worked a set number of hours in that year, and being less than 50 years old, do not verify competence.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The same may be said for the regional quotas and control over regional mobility within the province.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">There is accordingly no rational connection between the objective and the measures taken.</p><p style="background-color: #00FF00">Moreover, the requirements of the minimal impairment branch of the proportionality test have not been met.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">If the purpose of the legislation is viewed as ensuring the competency of construction workers, neither the limitation of the “freedom to associate” nor the limitation of the “freedom from association” is minimally impairing.</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">Section 30 and the regional quotas have little or nothing at all to do with competence and therefore cannot be viewed as minimal impairments of s. 2(d).</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">Statutes and Regulations Cited   Act Respecting Labour Relations, Vocational

R-20, and the regional regulatory quotas.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">The appellants directly challenged s. 30 of the Act as infringing s. 2(d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms; as noted by the appellants in their oral arguments, it is therefore necessary to consider all s. 2(d) issues that are raised.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Based on my view of the scope of the negative right and the analysis of the infringement of the positive right, I would allow the appeal.</p><p style="background-color: #00FF00">Section 2(d):  The Scope of the Negative Right   2                                   LeBel J. concludes that s. 2(d) of the Charter implies a negative right not to associate; he states that the test for an infringement of this right is whether there is evidence of ideological coercion or conformity imposed by the forced association.</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">Having found that no such ideological conformity exists in the present case, he finds no infringement of this right.</p><p style="background-color: #00FFFF">With respect, I disagree both with the test used and his ultimate finding in the present case.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">3                                   The test relied upon by LeBel J. is based primarily upon the decision of McLachlin J.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">(as she then was) in Lavigne v. Ontario Public Service Employees Union, 1991 CanLII 68 (SCC), [1991] 2 S.C.R.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">211.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">According to LeBel J., for ideological conformity to exist, there must be evidence of an imposition of union values or opinions on the member, evidence of a limitation of the member’s free expression, or evidence that the union participates in causes and activities of which the member disapproves (para.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">232).</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">In other words, LeBel J.’s interpretation of ideological conformity is a narrow one where, in order to exist, there must be some impact on the member’s moral convictions.</p><p style="background-color: #00FFFF">This test, as formulated by LeBel J., is, in my opinion, too narrow and results in a negative right that is too constrained.</p><p style="background-color: #00FFFF">I do not agree that McLachlin J.’s opinion in Lavigne need be interpreted so restrictively.</p><p style="background-color: #00FFFF">In my view, the interpretation of ideological conformity must be broader and take place in context.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">In this case, this context would take into account the true nature of unions as participatory bodies holding political and economic roles in society which, in turn, translates into the existence of ideological positions.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">To mandate that an individual adhere to such a union is ideological conformity.</p><p style="background-color: #00FFFF">4                                   It is evident that even prior to the coming into force of the Charter, ideological conformity was a major concern of the courts when considering forced association.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">In fact, this is shown by the Rand formula, which has been so important in the historical development of the union movement.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">According to Rand J., the democratic principle is an underlying value of prime importance in this analysis and any form of coercion affecting it must be taken very seriously.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">As noted by M.

U.A.W.-I.C.O.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">(1946), 46 C.L.L.C.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">¶18,001, Rand J. was concerned with individual workers’ rights and the democratic principles underlying union membership.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">He stated at p. 159:   As I conceive it, from the social and economic structure in which we live I must select considerations which have attained acceptance in the public opinion of this country and which as principles are relevant to controversies of the nature of that before me;   At pp.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">160 and 161, he noted that:       [O]rganized labour itself develops and depends upon power, which in turn must be met in balancing controls in relation to the individual members or workers over whom it may be exercised, as well as to industry and public.                                                                      . . .</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The organization of labour must in a civilized manner be elaborated and strengthened for its essential function in an economy of private enterprise.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">For this there must be enlightened leadership at the top and democratic control at the bottom.  . . .</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">Hitherto the tendency has been to treat labour as making demands quite unwarranted on any basis of democratic freedom in relation to property and business and the ordinary mode of settling labour disputes, a piecemeal concession in appeasement.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">I cannot see much effort to place conciliation on principle and although at once I disclaim any hope of doing more than to suggest principle through a slightly altered approach, I must at least make that attempt.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">He continued, at p. 163, discussing the balancing of union security with that of individual choice.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">He remarked:   What is asked for is a union shop with a check-off.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">A union shop permits the employer to engage employees at large, but requires that within a stated time after engagement they join the union or be dismissed if they do not.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">This is to be distinguished from what is known as a “closed shop” in which only a member of the union can be originally employed, which in turn means that the union becomes the source from which labour is obtained.   . . .  Where there is a closed or union shop, the check-off becomes less significant because of the fact that expulsion from the union requires dismissal from employment.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">In addition to the foregoing of which there may be many modifications, there is what is known as “maintenance of membership” which is a requirement that an employee member of a union maintain that membership as a condition to his continuing employment for a stated time, generally the life of an agreement.  . . .       Basing my judgment on principles which I think the large majority of Canadians accept, I am unable in the circumstances to award a union shop.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">It would subject the Company’s interest in individual employees and their tenure of service to strife within the union and between them and the union which, with extraordinary consequences, .</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">. . and it would deny the individual Canadian the right to seek work and to work independently of personal association with any organized group.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">It would also expose him even in a generally disciplined organization to the danger of arbitrary action of individuals and place his economic life at the mercy of the threat as well as the action of power in an uncontrolled and here an unmatured group.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">[Emphasis added.]</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">Finally, at p. 165, he concluded that the mechanism chosen “preserves the basic liberties of [the] Company and employee” (emphasis added) aforementioned.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">6                                   The Rand formula was discussed by this Court in Lavigne, supra.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Wilson J. noted the reason for the success of this type of clause in Canada and distinguished it from situations where union membership was mandatory.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">She stated, at p. 272:   Its success in Canada has stemmed from the fact that in enhancing union security it does not work to suppress expression but to foster it.</p><p style="background-color: #FF00FF">Why is this so?</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">Viewed closely, it is evident that there is nothing about the agency shop which purports to align those subject to its operation with the union or any of its activities.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">Indeed, the Rand formula specifically provides for dissent by stipulating that no member of the bargaining unit is required to join and thereby become a member of the union.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Free expression was thus enhanced by giving unionists and non-unionists alike a voice in the administration of the employment relationship.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">Finding that the Rand formula infringes s. 2(d) of the Charter but is justified by s. 1, La Forest J. also noted, at p. 341, that the Rand formula does not mandate union membership.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">Further, McLachlin J. remarked, at p. 347:   The whole purpose of the formula is to permit a person who does not wish to associate himself or herself with the union to desist from doing so.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The individual does this by declining to become a member of the union.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">The individual thereby dissociates himself or herself from the activities of the union.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">7                                   The infringement in the present case is much more important than that created by the Rand formula and requires justification that is therefore more extensive.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">It was decided in Lavigne that ideological conformity is at the core of freedom from association; it is not necessary to decide here whether it is the only factor to be considered in all cases, as will be shown later in these reasons.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">8                                   In order to understand the entire scope of the negative right, one must consider the impact of other Charter values on its infringement, as required under the rules of Charter interpretation described in R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., 1985 CanLII 69 (SCC), [1985] 1 S.C.R.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">295, where Dickson J.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">(as he then was) stated, at p. 344:   The meaning of a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter was to be ascertained by an analysis of the purpose of such a guarantee; it was to be understood, in other words, in the light of the interests it was meant to protect.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">In my view this analysis is to be undertaken, and the purpose of the right or freedom in question is to be sought by reference to the character and the larger objects of the Charter itself, to the language chosen to articulate the specific right or freedom, to the historical origins of the concepts enshrined, and where applicable, to the meaning and purpose of the other specific rights and freedoms with which it is associated within the text of the Charter.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The interpretation should be, as the judgment in Southam [Hunter v. Southam Inc., 1984 CanLII 33 (SCC), [1984] 2 S.C.R.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">145] emphasizes, a generous rather than a legalistic one, aimed at fulfilling the purpose of the guarantee and securing for individuals the full benefit of the Charter’s protection.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">At the same time it is important not to overshoot the actual purpose of the right or freedom in question, but to recall that the Charter was not enacted in a vacuum, and must therefore, as this Court’s decision in Law Society of Upper Canada v. Skapinker, 1984 CanLII 3 (SCC), [1984] 1 S.C.R.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">357, illustrates, be placed in its proper linguistic, philosophic and historical contexts.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">[First emphasis in original; second emphasis added.]</p><p style="background-color: #F5FFFA">Dickson C.J.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">referred to this decision in R. v.

division of powers confines the exercise by the federal Cabinet of Parliament’s delegated authority, and as to the appropriate methodology for reviewing regulations for compliance with the division of powers.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">The long-established principles set down in Crown Zellerbach should not be departed from.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The doctrine of stare decisis establishes a high threshold for departing from precedents and that threshold is not met in this case.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">There is disagreement with the majority’s modernization of the national concern doctrine and with the three-step framework it adopts, which dilutes the national concern test set down in Crown Zellerbach.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The framework adopted results in a new, distinctly hierarchical and supervisory model of Canadian federalism that subjects provincial legislative authority to Parliament’s overriding authority to establish national standards of how such authority may be exercised and replaces the constitutionally mandated division of powers with a judicially struck balance of power, which must account for other interests.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">No province, and not even Parliament itself, ever agreed to ⸺ or even contemplated ⸺ either of these features.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">This is a model of federalism that rejects the Constitution and re-writes the rules of Confederation.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Its implications go far beyond the Act, opening the door to federal intrusion ⸺ by way of the imposition of national standards ⸺ into all areas of provincial jurisdiction, including intra-provincial trade and commerce, health, and the management of natural resources.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">It is bound to lead to serious tensions in the federation.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">And all for no good reason, since Parliament could have achieved its goals in constitutionally valid ways.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">Per Rowe J.</p><p style="background-color: #00FFFF">(dissenting): The national concern doctrine is a residual power of last resort.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Faithful adherence to the doctrine leads inexorably to the conclusion that the national concern branch of the POGG power cannot be the basis for the constitutionality of the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act (“Act”).</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Accordingly, there is agreement with Brown J.’s analysis and with his conclusion that the Act is ultra vires in whole.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Federalism is one of the fundamental underlying principles animating the Canadian Constitution.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The primary textual expression of the principle of federalism can be found in the division of powers effected mainly by ss.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">91 and 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">An essential characteristic of the division of powers is its exhaustiveness, which precludes legislative voids and reconciles parliamentary sovereignty and federalism: it ensures that there is no subject matter which cannot be legislated upon and that Canada, as a whole, is fully sovereign.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The exhaustive nature of the division of powers means that matters that do not come within the enumerated classes must fit somewhere.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">This is dealt with by two residual clauses: one federal, and one provincial.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The federal residual clause, the POGG power, comes from the opening words of s. 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The provincial residual clause is in s. 92(16), and provides that the provincial legislatures may exclusively make laws relating to matters of “a merely local or private Nature in the Province”.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The wording of s. 91 provides textual support for the view that the POGG power is residual to s. 92, as s. 91 confers the power to legislate for peace, order and good government “in relation to all Matters not coming within the Classes of Subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces”.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Further, every conferral of provincial legislative jurisdiction is qualified by words such as “in the Province”, including s. 92(16).</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The result is that the POGG power is limited to only those matters that are not of a provincial nature, as the residual scope of the POGG power is narrowed by s. 92(16), which applies to matters that are of a local and private nature even if they do not come within any other enumerated head of power.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The scope of s. 92(16) must be interpreted as a counterbalance to the introductory paragraph of s. 91 to reflect the constitutional principle that both Parliament and provincial legislatures must be seen as equals.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The POGG power is also residual to the federal heads of power, as the normal process of constitutional interpretation is to rely first on a more specific provision before resorting to a more general one.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Since the POGG power is residual to both the enumerated provincial and federal heads of power, matters that come within enumerated federal or provincial heads of power should be located in those enumerated heads and the POGG power accommodates the matters which do not come within any of the enumerated federal or provincial heads.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">There is no reason to hold that a matter falls under POGG when it comes within an enumerated head of jurisdiction and it is not possible for a matter to fall both within the POGG power and within a federal enumerated head of power at the same time.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">If a matter cannot fit within any enumerated head, only then may resort be had to the federal residual clause.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">This methodology helps ensure that the federal residual power cannot be used as a tool to upset the balance of federalism by stripping away provincial powers.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Courts have long struggled to define the contours of the POGG power in a way that preserves the division of powers.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Early POGG cases suffered from a series of twists and turns, with various national concern statements infusing them at various points.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The common theme of these cases, however, is that courts rely on POGG to give effect to the exhaustive nature of the division of powers, but courts have always been cautious to guard provincial jurisdiction and ensure POGG does not become a vehicle for federal overreach.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The POGG jurisprudence should be read as signaling the existence of just two branches: a general residual power and the emergency power.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">What some commentators have named “gap” and “national concern” are simply manifestations of the exhaustive nature of the division of powers, and the residual nature of the POGG power.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Matters that do not come within any enumerated head of power or cannot be distributed among multiple heads of power must fit somewhere, and they belong under POGG when they pass the test set out in Crown Zellerbach.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">However, the analysis of the Crown Zellerbach framework would be the same even if there is only one residual authority (POGG) and even if there are three branches to POGG.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The national concern doctrine, when properly applied, plays an essential role in achieving the goal that the division of powers be collectively exhaustive, in a way that respects provincial jurisdiction.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Matters that do not come within one of the enumerated heads of jurisdiction and that cannot be separated and shared between the enumerated heads of jurisdiction of both orders of government do not fit comfortably within the division of powers.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">14                               In Reference re Public Service Employee Relations Act (Alta.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">),

United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948, . . . .</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">This construction of the associational right in two reflective strands serves to recognize the often overlooked potential for coercion in association.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Governmental tyranny can manifest itself not only in constraints on association, but in forced association.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">There is no logical inconsistency in recognizing this reality.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">Nor do I accept the proposition that including the right to be free from compelled association within the reach of s. 2(d) will weaken or “trivialize” the cherished right to be free to form associations.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">It will do nothing but strengthen it.</p><p style="background-color: #FF00FF">Moreover, the purposive approach to Charter interpretation demands such a result.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Finally, that some aspects of the freedom may be protected by ss.</p><p style="background-color: #FF00FF">7, 2(a) or 2(b) of the Charter, to cite the most obvious possibilities, should not dissuade us from giving full meaning to s. 2(d).</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">All of the liberties guaranteed by the Charter are particular aspects of the broader freedom we enjoy in Canada.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">As the Court noted in R. v. Lyons, 1987 CanLII 25 (SCC), [1987] 2 S.C.R.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">309, at p. 326:   Before entering into a detailed discussion of the issues, it may be useful to note that this case exemplifies the rather obvious point that the rights and freedoms protected by the Charter are not insular and discrete (see, e.g., my comments in this regard in R. v. Rahey, 1987 CanLII 52 (SCC), [1987] 1 S.C.R.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">588).</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">Rather, the Charter protects a complex of interacting values, each more or less fundamental to the free and democratic society that is Canada (R. v. Oakes, .</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">. .), and the particularization of rights and freedoms contained in the Charter thus represents a somewhat artificial, if necessary and intrinsically worthwhile attempt to structure and focus the judicial exposition of such rights and freedoms.</p><p style="background-color: #00FFFF">The necessity of structuring the discussion should not, however, lead us to overlook the importance of appreciating the manner in which the amplification of the content of each enunciated right and freedom imbues and informs our understanding of the value structure sought to be protected by the Charter as a whole and, in particular, of the content of the other specific rights and freedoms it embodies.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Accordingly, a person is not deprived of protection under a provision of the Charter merely because protection may also be derived under another.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The rights overlap in defining Canadian society, and I see no reason for depriving a litigant of success because he has chosen one provision that legitimately appears to cover the matter of which he or she complains, rather than another.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">That would often be the effect if the individual rights and freedoms were construed as  discrete rather than overlapping.</p><p style="background-color: #FF00FF">16                               He went on to discuss the scope of this Charter right.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">In doing so, he noted that s. 2(d) has limitations and that it was not meant to protect the people of Canada from the association with others that is “a necessary and inevitable part of membership in a democratic community” (p. 320).</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">He mentioned governmental policies requiring the payment of taxes and the association with others that is compelled by the organization of our society, such as membership in a family.</p><p style="background-color: #00FFFF">I am not persuaded that these are examples of true associations as envisaged within the meaning of s. 2(d) or that they constitute true exceptions to the freedom from association.</p><p style="background-color: #FF00FF">In this, I think we have to be guided by the purpose of the section.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">On this point, it is worth quoting La Forest J., at pp.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">322-23, where he stated:   At the core of the guarantee of freedom of association is the individual’s freedom to choose the path to self-actualization.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">This is an aspect of the autonomy of the individual.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">It is of little solace to a person who is compelled to associate with others against his or her own will that no one will attribute the views of the group to that person.  . . .  Consequently, the test should not be whether the payments “may reasonably be seen” as association, or must “indicate to any reasonable person” that the individual has associated himself with an ideological cause.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">An external manifestation of some link between the individual and the association is not a prerequisite to the invocation of the right; it is enough that the individual’s freedom is impaired.</p><p style="background-color: #FF00FF">I think this has to be read with the words of Dickson C.J.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">in Oakes, supra, at p. 136:   The Court must be guided by the values and principles essential to a free and democratic society which I believe embody, to name but a few, respect for the inherent dignity of the human person, commitment to social justice and equality, accommodation of a wide variety of beliefs, respect for cultural and group identity, and faith in social and political institutions which enhance the participation of individuals and groups in society.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">17                               The recognition of the union movement as a fundamental institution is implicit here precisely because it is a participant in the political and social debate at the core of Canadian democracy.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">To suggest that the unions in the present case are not associated with any ideological cause is to ignore the history of the union movement itself.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Although it has been accepted that freedom of association protects an activity by an association that is permitted by an individual, this does not mean that there is no distinctive function for an association, or that associational analogues to individual rights need be ignored.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The collective character of the right to associate is undeniable because collective activity is not equivalent to the addition of individual activities.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">It is important, however, that belonging to important social institutions be free; this is how democracy will be enhanced.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">18                               Discussing limitations on the freedom from association, La Forest J. noted that some of the liberty interests at issue in the context of the right to be free from association were discussed by Professor B. Etherington in his article “Freedom of Association and Compulsory Union Dues:  Towards a Purposive Conception of a Freedom to not Associate” (1987), 19 Ottawa L. Rev.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">1, and include (at pp.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">43-44):   1.    governmental establishment of, or support for, particular political parties or causes;   2.    impairment of the individual’s freedom to join or associate with causes of his choice;   3.    the imposition of ideological conformity; and   4.    personal identification of an objector with political or ideological causes which the service association supports.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">La Forest J. noted that this view is consistent with the reasons of Dickson J. in Big M Drug Mart, supra.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">19                               I agree with La Forest and McLachlin JJ.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">that there is a negative aspect to the s. 2(d) right.</p><p style="background-color: #00FFFF">However, I do not think it is useful to distinguish between the factors proposed by Professor Etherington or to formulate a definitive opinion with regard to the various factors that could, in any given situation, provide a framework for the conclusion that freedom from association has been breached.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">With regard to the content of the right, it is sufficient to refer to ideological conformity in this case because that factor has already been recognized, because it is at play and because its scope is such that it encompasses all aspects of the case on its facts.</p><p style="background-color: #FF00FF">I am left here with a number of options.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">For instance, I could accept that there is an internal qualification of the negative aspect of s. 2(d) and that it is triggered by the infringement of a liberty interest, other Charter values and/or the imposition of ideological conformity; or I could accept that there is a negative aspect to s. 2(d) and that a s. 1 justification is immediately required upon a finding that there has been state-imposed association.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">First, a distinction may be made between the exceptions to s. 2(d) protection, as discussed by La Forest J. and noted at para.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">16 of these reasons, and true associations which are protected by s. 2(d).</p><p style="background-color: #00FFFF">Although not necessary to determine in this case, as these exceptions are not brought into play by the factual situation in issue, it may be said that these “necessary” associations do not truly fall within the purpose of s. 2(d) protection since they do not involve persons coming together in the pursuit of a common goal or purpose as this is generally understood.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">Association in a labour organization would not in any case be part of the “necessary” associations category.</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">Further, any element of necessity which would impact protections provided by s. 2(d) would, in my opinion, fall within a s. 1 justification of a s. 2(d) infringement rather than at the initial Charter breach analysis.</p><p style="background-color: #00FFFF">Second, it should be added that even if forced associations in and of themselves should not be considered ab initio contrary to universal values or principles, once coercion is applied by government to association in circumstances where ideological conformity is imposed, I believe s. 2(d) is infringed and the government must justify this forced association pursuant to s. 1.</p><p style="background-color: #00FFFF">20                               I would add here that I disagree with the statement of LeBel J. at para.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">199 of his reasons that La Forest J. was of the opinion that the obligation to join a union whose purposes were limited to collective bargaining would not even engage s. 2(d).</p><p style="background-color: #00FFFF">This inference, in my view, is not consistent with the fact that La Forest J.’s discussions of constitutional issues in Lavigne had nothing to do with mandatory membership (see p. 325).</p><p style="background-color: #00FFFF">Furthermore, this is not relevant here, as will be demonstrated later, because the association in question goes beyond the purpose of collective bargaining.</p><p style="background-color: #00FF00">Section 2(d):  Was the Negative Right Infringed?</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">21                               D. Wright notes in his article  “Unions and Political Action:  Labour Law, Union Purposes and Democracy” (1998), 24 Queen’s L.J.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">1, at p. 7:   Though labour has supported a variety of political parties over the years, trade union support for organized political parties has been a prominent part of labour’s activities throughout most of this century.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">22                               He states that labour has played an important part in the development of the New Democratic Party and Parti québécois and that the purpose of trade unions transcends that of collective bargaining on behalf of members and includes, as a fundamental purpose, the political representation of members.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">Rand J. noted that union representation is about power, as seen earlier.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">LeBel J. explains that the history of labour relations in Quebec is rife with violence and dissonance.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Eventually, a system of representative unions was recognized by legislation.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">In 1974, after violence broke out at the James Bay Project site, the government set up the Cliche Commission.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">The representative union system was modified and a system of regional quotas was created.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">In discussing the political activity of representative unions in Quebec, G.

Boivin and J. Guilbault, in Les relations patronales-syndicales au Québec (1982), also write, at pp.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">85-86, under the title “Le gouvernement du Parti québécois et l’orientation idéologique des centrales syndicales”:   [translation] The arrival of a new party on the provincial political scene -- the Parti québécois founded in 1968 -- would enable the popular discontent with traditional parties to be chanelled and would give a number of union activists the opportunity to become actively involved in political activity.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">As a result, the Parti québécois benefited from the support of a large number of volunteers experienced in working with groups such as social movements and unions.                                                                      . . .   Over and above its role as a sovereignist party, which is its main raison d’être, the Parti québécois openly asserted its “bias in favour of workers” without being a true labour party, such as the Labour Party in England or even the NDP in Canada.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">In addition to being founded on traditional electoral reasons, this aspect of the PQ’s political agenda corresponds to the party’s sociological reality which, as we have already noted, relies largely on the social movements and the union activists from all the central labour bodies.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The PQ’s exercise of power since 1976 has enabled the scope of this “bias in favour of workers” to be confirmed and has resulted in the various labour organizations clarifying their real ideological orientation.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">Interestingly, at p. 87, the authors commence to discuss the ideological orientation of key unions in Quebec, notably the FTQ, the CSN, the CEQ and the CSD.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">This is the backdrop upon which the statutory provisions in the Act and its Regulations fall.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">It is relevant to the consideration of the concept of ideological conformity.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The social and economic impact of the union movement is a matter of general knowledge.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">23                               The legislation in question here is complex; it creates an entire labour relations scheme which governs, amongst other matters, union membership, employers associations, collective bargaining and the creation of the Commission de la construction du Québec and committees on construction and vocational training.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">24                               The mis en cause argues that the action against the appellants was directed solely at their failure to obtain competency certificates.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">According to the mis en cause, there is a distinction between this requirement and the requirement to become a member of one of the five recognized employee associations.</p><p style="background-color: #00FFFF">I disagree with this assertion.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The scheme of the Act provides that both requirements must be met as conditions precedent to working in the construction industry in Quebec; these conditions are certified together on one document, referred to as the competency certificate, and the only way to receive such a certificate pursuant to s. 39 of the Act is if both conditions have been met.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">As stated by Trudel J., 1998 CanLII 11295 (QC CS), [1998] R.J.Q.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">911, at p. 923:       [translation] Without an identity card establishing his or her membership in one of these five representative associations, an employee cannot work in Quebec in the construction sector.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">His or her competency, in other words, since it is acquired largely on the job, is directly related to his or her forced association with one of the five bargaining agents currently recognized by the Act for construction workers.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">This is confirmed in ss.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">36 and 36.1 of the Act and by s. 23 of the Regulation respecting the election of a representative association by the employees of the construction industry, (1997) 129 O.G.</p><p style="background-color: #F5FFFA">II, 1866.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">As admitted by the intervener Commission de la construction du Québec, at para.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">60 of its factum, this was also the practice in Quebec prior to the coming into force of this Regulation.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">25                               The mis en cause also argues that designating a representative union is not the same as becoming a member of a union.</p><p style="background-color: #FF00FF">Again, I disagree with this technical distinction.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Although these unions are stated to be recognized for representative collective bargaining purposes, they remain “unions”, as exemplified by ss.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">1(a), 17(9) and 38 of the Act.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Further, the Act clearly views those who elect a representative union as “members” of that union, as can be seen in numerous provisions, including s. 30, which makes them “electors” within the association, s. 34, which states that the Commission will forward a list of employees “who have become members of such association”, and s. 39, which speaks of his membership in the representative union (see also ss.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">31, 32, 41, 96(2), 99, 101, 104, and 119).</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The only contrary argument that can be found is in s. 102, which states that no association can discriminate against an employee for “abstain[ing] from belonging to any association”; however, both ss.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">32 and 94 suggest that the employee must choose one of the five chosen representative unions.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">This was even acknowledged by counsel for the mis en cause at the oral hearing when he stated:  [translation] “we are not claiming that there is no associative act here resulting from the choice made by any employee, which is mandatory” (emphasis added).</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">In his factum, he also noted, at paras.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">26 and 38, that pursuant to s. 39, all new construction employees must choose a representative association and in the event of failure to do so, the worker cannot be employed.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">Finally, it is noteworthy that the role of the union is to represent the interests of its “members”, as stated in the definition of “association” in s. 1(a).</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">This was also mentioned in the mis en cause’s factum where it is stated, at para.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">53, that, pursuant to s. 94, the right to belong to a representative union means the right to become a member and participate in its activities.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">26                               In the December 16, 1968 debates of the Legislative Assembly surrounding Bill 290 (i.e.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">the first version of the present legislation in 1968), wherein the idea of representative association for collective bargaining was introduced, Jean-Paul Lefebvre stated (3rd sess., 28th Leg., vol.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">7, No.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">105, at p. 4987):   [translation] Will it permit the labour movement -- especially the two central labour bodies -- to represent the workers in accordance with their wishes but in a climate of improved co-operation, while at the same time allowing the normal competition between the different unions to continue?</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">In fact -- and I think we should be happy about this -- we do not have a union monopoly in our province; rather we have a “duopoly” which, when you really think about it, promotes greater freedom for the workers, in my opinion.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">In discussing the consequences of having one dominant union and one minority union, it was also said in the debates (at p. 4998) that both will wish to get the confidence of the workers and that:   [translation] The result is that one of the unions will pride itself on providing better service to its members.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">At p. 520 of the mis en cause’s record, the Cliche Commission report (Rapport de la Commission d’enquête sur l’exercice de la liberté syndicale dans l’industrie de la construction (1975), at p. 8) is quoted:   [translation]  Individual Rights of Workers   The Commission is convinced that: –                                                                      .</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">. .   2 -- The construction worker must enjoy freedom of choice to belong to one of the two existing associations, that is, to the one that he believes embodies his aspirations as a free man.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">[Emphasis added.]</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The record shows many more references to membership under the Act.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">For instance, in Historique des relations du travail dans l’industrie de la construction au Québec (1990) by the Commission de la construction du Québec, it was stated (at p. 6):   [translation] The legislator ensures, among other things, the workers’ freedom of choice regarding union membership and prohibits any discrimination in hiring on the basis of that membership.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">For that reason, Bill 290 contains the necessary provisions to bring about mandatory unionization and will thereby enable unions to increase their membership rapidly.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">[Emphasis added.]</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">At p. 11, it was stated:   [translation] Moreover, mandatory union membership is established since “every employee must, as a condition of the maintenance of his employment, become and remain a member in good standing of one or the other of the union associations” (s. 7.01).</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">At p. 528 of the mis en cause’s record, the Cliche Commission report (at p. 24) is again quoted:     [translation] After this legislation is passed,  .</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">. . every employee must join the union association of his choice and remain a member thereof.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">27                               As stated, I disagree that s. 30 and those that follow it in the Act imply a freedom to join a union or not; rather, membership in one of the unions is obligatory.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">Furthermore, membership has meaning.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Membership is about sharing values, joining to pursue goals in common, expressing views reflecting the position of a particular group in society.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">It is worth quoting again Boivin and Guilbault, supra, briefly, at pp.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">87-89.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">They write:   [translation] The new ideological orientation of the various union organizations in Quebec can no doubt best be understood  through the type of relationships maintained by each central labour body with the government and through the type of  criticisms directed to the government.                                                                      . . .

As a result, although this central labour body had  partially espoused the ideological language of the CSN and the CEQ during a certain period of time, the election of the Parti québécois government would establish beyond any doubt that the FTQ was far from having radical goals on a sociopolitical level.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">The FTQ’s current political discourse is found in the

Although it may not be quite accurate to associate these two central labour bodies on an ideological level, they nonetheless have enough similarities to be the subject of a common analysis.

certain “democratic socialism”, but since they still refuse to participate actively in creating a political party, the concrete expression of this socialism has not yet been defined.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">There is thus a large gap between words and action for these two central labour bodies, as the affiliated labour organizations continue to put into practice (and very effectively in the public sector, where most of their members are recruited) the principles of North American business unionism.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">(c)   The CSD   Because its existence is based on a systematic opposition to the CSN’s ideological radicalism, it is easier to define what the CSD’s ideology is not than what it is.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">This refusal to blatantly condemn the capitalist system must not however lead us to regard the CSD affiliates as company unions.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">Although the CSD is not trying to destroy the capitalist system in which it exists, it nevertheless wants to change it profoundly by seeking the collective advancement of workers while remaining completely independent of political parties.   . . .</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">It endeavours to establish a greater democracy in the workplace.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">The program put forward by the central labour organization thus deals with, among other things, “changes in business operations through the sociotechnical approach, enriching job duties through new forms of work organization, improving work stations through ergonomics, etc.”       It is because of the collective force produced by membership that unions can be a potent force in public debate, that they can influence Parliament and the legislatures in their functions, that they can bargain effectively.</p><p style="background-color: #00FF00">This force must be constituted democratically to conform to s. 2(d).</p><p style="background-color: #F5FFFA">LeBel J. states at para.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">165 that the legislative system in Quebec reflects, on the surface, a “union shop” approach.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">However, for a “union shop” to exist, there must be a properly constituted union.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">This Court in Lavigne discussed the role of unions and stressed their democratic nature.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">In particular, in describing the general structure of labour relations, La Forest J. emphasized (at p. 325) that it involves “democratically run bodies” and “certification of a union when a majority of employees choose to be represented by that union” which contemplates “majoritarian decision‐making”.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">In the present case, I fail to see how the precondition to a “union shop” exists; in other words, I fail to see how the legislative scheme in Quebec falls within the general structure of labour relations as discussed previously by this Court.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">28                               This case is one that shows how interrelated Charter rights and values can be.</p><p style="background-color: #FF00FF">It is not necessary to have more independent evidence of the ideological views of the specific unions involved in this case.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">This is not novel since such was the case in Lavigne.</p><p style="background-color: #00FFFF">I disagree with LeBel J.’s views at para.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">227 of his reasons and would affirm that it is in fact sufficient that adherence is required to a scheme advocating state-imposed compulsory membership which affects freedom of conscience and expression, as well as liberty and mobility interests, for it to have a negative impact on the right to work, because such adherence itself is a form of ideological coercion.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Ideological constraint exists in particular where membership numbers are used to promote ideological agendas and, as noted in Lavigne, at p. 322, this is so even where there is no evidence that the union is coercing its members to believe in what it promotes.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">After discussing the use of union dues for actual workplace expenditures, La Forest J. stated, at p. 330:   When, however, the Union purports to express itself in respect to matters reflecting aspects of Lavigne’s identity and membership in the community that go beyond his bargaining unit and its immediate concerns, his claim to the protection of the Charter cannot as easily be dismissed.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">In regard to these broader matters, his claim is not to absolute isolation but to be free to make his own choices, unfettered by the opinion of those he works with, as to what associations, if any, he will be associated with outside the workplace.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">[Emphasis added.]</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">He further stated, at p. 332:       In my view, it is more consistent with the generous approach to be applied to the interpretation of rights under the Charter to hold that the freedom of association of an individual member of a bargaining unit will be violated when he or she is compelled to contribute to causes, ideological or otherwise, that are beyond the immediate concerns of the bargaining unit.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">29                               In the present case, workers objected to being forced to join a union and objected generally to the compulsory unionization scheme, which is, in my view, ideological in nature.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">30                               The approach I advocate to the interpretation of the right is consistent in particular with the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">It provides that:   Article 6.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">1.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">The States Parties to the present Covenant recognize the right to work, which includes the right of everyone to the opportunity to gain his living by work which he freely chooses or accepts, and will take appropriate steps to safeguard this right.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">[Emphasis added.]</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">This provision was noted by this Court in Canadian Egg Marketing Agency, supra, where discussing the importance of s. 6 of the Charter, Iacobucci J. and I stated, at para.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">60:   The freedom guaranteed in s. 6 embodies a concern for the dignity of the individual.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">Sections 6(2)(b) and 6(3)(a) advance this purpose by guaranteeing a measure of autonomy in terms of personal mobility, and by forbidding the state from undermining this mobility and autonomy through discriminatory treatment based on place of residence, past or present.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">The freedom to pursue a livelihood is essential to self-fulfilment as well as survival.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Section 6 is meant to give effect to the basic human right, closely related to equality, that individuals should be able to participate in the economy without being subject to legislation which discriminates primarily on the basis of attributes related to mobility in pursuit of their livelihood.</p><p style="background-color: #FF00FF">This sentiment builds upon the reasoning of Dickson C.J.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">(dissenting) in Alberta Reference, supra, where he stated, at p. 368:   Work is one of the most fundamental aspects in a person’s life, providing the individual with a means of financial support and, as importantly, a contributory role in society.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">A person’s employment is an essential component of his or her sense of identity, self-worth and emotional well-being.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Accordingly, the conditions in which a person works are highly significant in shaping the whole compendium of psychological, emotional and physical elements of a person’s dignity and self respect.</p><p style="background-color: #00FFFF">31                               This is a case where the freedom not to associate is markedly infringed.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">I respectfully disagree with LeBel J. when he advocates deference to the choices of government on giving content to the notions of “self-actualization” (para.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">210) and “democracy” (paras.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">228 and 229).</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">I disagree with his view that the present matter “lie[s] largely beyond the area of expertise of courts” (para.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">239).</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">In my opinion, though problems may have been acute in this area, not all options are open to government.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">This is a clear situation of government coercion, the result of which mandates that workers in the construction industry in Quebec group together in a few unions which are specified and approved by government.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The fact that there are five unions from which workers can choose in no way negates this infringement for it remains government-mandated group affiliation.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Self-realization of the worker is violated in many ways.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">He or she must unionize.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Within the prescribed regime, democracy is further restricted by limited choice.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">There is no guarantee that a majority of voters will exercise their right.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">A default provision can determine the outcome of elections.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Those voting for minority associations may be left out of future negotiations.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">32                               The vast majority of Canadians must work for a living and, as such, working is a compelled fact of life; however, in the present situation, the appellants are not arguing that being forced to work with a particular group or to participate in employment-related activities violates s. 2(d).</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">This is not a case where workers dispute the payment of mandated union dues; the restrictions in this case are much more severe than that in Lavigne.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The Rand formula mandates payment of union dues for the betterment of all workers; in this case, the workers are being forced to join a union.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">As argued by the appellants, being forced by the government to join one of five specified unions differs drastically from being forced to pay union dues.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">The appellants state (factum, at para.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">24):   The objection to union membership can be anchored in profound moral, religious or political convictions and it is implicit in Canadian law that such convictions are to be respected.</p><p style="background-color: #00FFFF">I agree with this assertion.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">Lavigne focussed on the actual activities of the union in question and the purpose for which union dues were used.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">This situation, on the other hand, even if it is not based on the actual views held by the five unions, comprises a form of ideological conformity.</p><p style="background-color: #00FFFF">33                               As I have said, it is not necessary to make a conclusive determination of whether these liberty interests are separate indices of a s. 2(d) infringement or whether they are merely subcategories of ideological conformity since, in this case, ideological conformity, which was explicitly accepted by both La Forest and McLachlin JJ.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">in Lavigne, exists.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Workers may feel strongly about joining a union for various reasons, but whether they are moral, religious or political, these beliefs and convictions must be pushed aside if one wishes to work in the construction industry in Quebec.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">They are the only workers affected in this way.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">When considering freedom not to associate in light of other Charter values, including freedom of conscience and expression, liberty, mobility and the right to work, I cannot help but find that governmental mandatory union association infringes this important Charter right.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">34                               As I have said, ideological conformity is engaged in particular because the members of the associations necessarily participate in and indirectly support a system of forced association and state control over work opportunity.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">This is a situation whereby the democratic rights of workers are taken away.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Being forced to accept and participate in a system that severely limits the democratic principle in the area of labour relations is a form of coercion that cannot be segregated totally from ideological conformity.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">If Parliament provided that a person must belong to a specific political party to work in the public service of Canada, the situation would be analogous.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Some would argue that one does not have to believe, simply that one has to belong; as stated at para.</p><p style="background-color: #00FFFF">16, I believe there would still be clear ideological conformity.</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">35                               Since ideological conformity is part of the broader test to which I subscribe, I conclude that the challenged statutory provisions infringe the negative right which forms part of s. 2(d).</p><p style="background-color: #00FFFF">36                               I do not believe that this conclusion is inconsistent with previous jurisprudence.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">For example, the Rand formula differs from the case at bar because it does not negate the democratic principle; in that case, a majority of workers choose accreditation and approve the collective agreement.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Workers can still choose to work in a non-unionized environment.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The ultimate forced association is then justified by the majority principle and the underlying need to have a system of protection of workers that is effective.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">There is also a distinction to be made with the requirements of professional associations such as medical associations and law societies, where the need for protection of the public may require a forced association which is justified under s. 1 of the Charter.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">In this case, the provisions are not based on the protection of the public by way of assuring the competency of workers.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">To receive certification, a worker must be a member of one of the five chosen unions; to become a member, he or she must have been a resident of Quebec in the previous year, have worked a set number of hours in that year and must be under 50 years of age.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Without having met these requirements, a worker is unable to work in Quebec regardless of his or her actual competence or experience in his or her chosen trade.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The conditions related to forced association have nothing to do with the protection of the public.</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">As stated by Judge Bonin of the Court of Québec, [translation] “[t]he certificate’s main purpose was to maintain hiring priority”.</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">As such, a s. 1 justification is required.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Before considering s. 1, however, I turn next to the examination of the positive right which is also part of s. 2(d).</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">Section 2(d) -- The Positive Right   37                               As previously discussed, the appellants argue that s. 30, which establishes the conditions under which a competency card can be obtained, and the regional quota requirements limiting the right to be placed on the union lists are unconstitutional.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">As such, even if there was no infringement of the right not to associate, there would still be a need to consider whether there is a breach of the positive right to associate.</p><p style="background-color: #FF00FF">This has not been dealt with by LeBel J., who takes another view of the purpose and effect of s. 30 of the Act.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">38                               I have mentioned that, pursuant to s. 30, construction workers can only be placed on the employer’s list and join a union pursuant to s. 32 if they were a resident of Quebec in the previous year, worked 300 hours in that year and were under 50 years of age.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">The Commission de la construction du Québec forwards a card to the workers on this list (s. 36).</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">No employer may use the services of a person in the construction industry unless that person holds one of these cards (s. 39).</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">Therefore, if the s. 30 requirements are not met, a person may not join one of the five unions and, as a result, cannot work in Quebec.</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">In addition, as acknowledged by the Commission de la construction du Québec, at para.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">24 of their intervener’s factum, at the material time, there were regional quotas in place which also limited the number of workers in each predetermined region within the province.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">For persons living in and outside the province of Quebec, their ability to join one of the unions and thereby work in the construction industry is severely restricted by these arbitrary requirements.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">For example, a person who had lived in Quebec all of his life but was not a resident in the previous year, because he was attending school or working elsewhere in the country, would be excluded.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The same may be said for a person who has never left the province but simply did not work in the industry in the previous year or a person who wishes to train and start working in the industry for the first time.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">In the latter case, even if he held an apprentice competency certificate or an occupation competency certificate, which has its own barriers as will be discussed, he cannot join the union until he has worked 300 hours or the equivalent thereof while in training.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">These barriers to association are even more pronounced for those persons who did not reside in the province of Quebec in the previous year.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">39                               Section 30 of the Act refers to three types of competency certificates:  the journeyman competency certificate, the occupation competency certificate and the apprentice competency certificate.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">Sections 2 and 2.1 of the Regulation respecting the issuance of competency certificates, (1987) 119 O.G.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">II, 1471, govern the issuance of an apprentice competency certificate.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Aside from other requirements, at the material time and at present, s. 2.1 provides that a maximum number of these certificates may be granted in any given year.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">This quota is only expanded in cases where there is an insufficient number of workers in a region; in those cases, certificates may be granted to those who meet the requirements, one of which is being a resident of the region in question (s. 3).</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">As with the apprentice competency certificate, the occupation competency certificates are granted only within the parameters of a quota.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">One cannot receive an occupation competency certificate without having completed a course approved by the Commission; however, the Commission decides how many positions shall be available in these courses based on the number of workers required per region (ss.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">4 and 4.1).</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">As such, both the apprentice competency certificate and the occupation competency certificate can be refused based on regional quotas.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">For a person entering the industry, it therefore means that his or her ability to get a competency certificate, which is a condition precedent for union membership pursuant to s. 30 of the Act, could be denied merely because a government-designated quota has been reached.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">40                               The journeyman competency certificate differs slightly.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Pursuant to s. 1 of the Regulation respecting the issuance of competency certificates, a journeyman competency certificate is issued to the holder of a qualification certificate or attestation of experience pursuant to the Regulation respecting the vocational training and qualification of manpower in the construction industry, R.R.Q.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">1981, c. F-5, r. 3.</p><p style="background-color: #00FF00">This Regulation defines the qualification certificate as “a certificate issued by the Department attesting to the level of qualification acquired by the holder in a trade governed by the Act” and an attestation of experience as “a document issued by exception by the Department proving that the holder has plyed a trade in whole or in part”.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Section 7 of this Regulation states that a qualification certificate may be granted to anyone who has completed apprenticeship in conformity with this Regulation or anyone who can prove he or she has gained experience by working in the trade equal to the number of periods in Schedule B of the Regulation.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Turning first to the completion of apprenticeship, which would apply to newcomers to these trades, s. 16 of the Regulation discusses the requirements for admission to apprenticeship and states that amongst other requirements, the person must hold a classification certificate under the Regulation respecting the placement of employees in the construction industry, R.R.Q.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">1981, c. R-20, r. 10.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">This latter Regulation provides that a classification certificate is issued to anyone meeting the requirement of having worked in the industry for a certain number of hours in the preceding five calendar years (s. 6).</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">As a result, this certificate may be granted if an experienced person has worked in the industry for a certain number of hours in the past five years; however, this must also be considered in light of s. 30 provisions which continue to mandate that, to join the union and become an employee, a person must have worked at least 300 hours in the industry in the preceding calendar year.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">For those from outside the province, the possibilities are even bleaker.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Section 10 provides that a special classification certificate may be issued to an employee domiciled outside Quebec if he or she previously obtains a guarantee of employment from an employer registered with the Board.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Since s. 10 requires that a person outside Quebec obtain employment prior to being granted a certificate of qualification, the requirements of s. 30 must have already been met and a competency card must have been issued to the worker in his or her case; otherwise, the employer would be in violation of s. 39 of the Act.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">41                               In fact, a person from outside Quebec cannot get a qualification certificate without employment and, as such, cannot get a journeyman competency certificate without employment; he or she cannot get employment without holding one of the three types of competency cards.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Although there are no quota requirements applicable to the journeyman competency certificate, it is unlikely, if ever, that a person from outside Quebec will hold one of these cards and, as such, he or she will be required to hold an apprentice competency certificate, or occupation competency certificate, which will not occur if the regional quotas are filled.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Therefore, even if workers have met the requirements stated in s. 30, they may not receive a competency card, join the union or be permitted to work.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">42                               In summary, there are severe restrictions on the right of a person to join one of the five chosen unions in order to work in the construction industry in Quebec.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Even if the conditions imposed by s. 30 of the Act were permissible limitations on freedom of association, the regional quotas would still need to be justified under s. 1.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">They unduly infringe the ability of workers to join a union, which is a prerequisite for working in the construction industry in Quebec.</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">As such, they are an infringement of the s. 2(d) freedom of association.</p><p style="background-color: #00FF00">Section 1:  Is the Infringement of s. 2(d) Justifiable?</p><p style="background-color: #00FF00">43                               In determining whether this infringement can be justified by s. 1, this Court must again take into consideration Charter values including liberty, freedom of expression, the right to work and mobility rights.</p><p style="background-color: #00FF00">For the government to justify infringing a Charter right, it must prove on a balance of probabilities that the objective of the impugned legislation is pressing and substantial.</p><p style="background-color: #00FF00">It must then show that the infringement is proportionate.</p><p style="background-color: #00FF00">In other words, there must be a rational connection between the objective in question and the measures adopted.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">These measures must not be arbitrary, unfair or based on irrational considerations.</p><p style="background-color: #00FF00">The means should impair as little as possible the freedom in question.</p><p style="background-color: #00FF00">There must also be proportionality between the objective and the effect of the measures (Oakes, supra).</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">44                               The mis en cause submits that it is in the public interest to have structured collective bargaining.</p><p style="background-color: #00FF00">In discussing the purpose of the legislation, the mis en cause submits that the objective of s. 30 of the Act is to establish the degree of representativeness of the associations in question for collective bargaining purposes (factum, at para.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">72).</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">It notes that these are an integral part of a labour relations regime put in place to ensure industrial peace.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">Consistent with the above argument, it is clear from the mis en cause’s oral submissions that the only purpose of the imposed association is collective bargaining and that this is both a non-protected right and an activity that is in the interest of the workers.</p><p style="background-color: #00FF00">In my view, it is not so much the activity undertaken by the association that is relevant in determining whether or not the legislative objective is pressing and substantial; it is the purpose of the Act itself and of the requirement that workers join one of five specified unions in order to participate in the industry in question.</p><p style="background-color: #00FFFF">45                               The mis en cause provides this Court with a historical perspective and argues that nothing short of this overall regime works in this industry in Quebec.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">LeBel J. agrees and acknowledges that s. 30 was merely adopted to determine which unions will enrol the members and will thereby be given representative status.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">His justification for these findings is based on documents and events that predate the Charter.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Proving necessity requires a context based on present realities and circumstances.</p><p style="background-color: #00FFFF">As such, it would be a rare case, in my view, where what was justified in the past when no Charter values were involved would be determinative.</p><p style="background-color: #00FFFF">This is consistent with this Court’s decision in Big M Drug Mart, supra, where it was stated that it is not sufficient to consider the objective of the legislation prior to the coming into force of the Charter.</p><p style="background-color: #FF00FF">This Court must consider the objective of the legislation as it stands today.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">At a minimum, the mis en cause should have given evidence of the actual functioning of the system, the participation of workers in the limited democratic process provided, and the reasons that justify infringement of the democratic right and extreme restriction of the positive right of association.</p><p style="background-color: #FF00FF">46                               The mis en cause does not discuss the s. 30 requirements which must be met in order to work in Quebec, or the regional quotas.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">I accept that it is in the public interest to have structured collective bargaining and to provide for competency requirements; these are no doubt pressing and substantial objectives.</p><p style="background-color: #00FFFF">But I have difficulty accepting that these are the true objectives of the impugned provisions.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The legislation brings into play restrictions on the admission to the industry, cancellation of the ability to have a non-unionized business, restrictions on bargaining rights, imposition of regional quotas and impingement of regional mobility.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The mis en cause has not demonstrated that there is a logical relationship between its stated objectives and these restrictions.</p><p style="background-color: #00FF00">Even if I did accept the stated objectives and found a link to exist, the mis en cause would fail to meet the requirements of the minimal impairment branch of the proportionality tests.</p><p style="background-color: #00FF00">47                               Regarding the relationship between forced association and the objective stated, the mis en cause submits that it is essential to collective bargaining in this area to limit the number of actors in this industry.</p><p style="background-color: #FF00FF">This is an argument based on the history of labour relations in Quebec.</p><p style="background-color: #00FFFF">However, as stated above, the mis en cause has failed to show that permitting structured collective bargaining is the true purpose of these provisions as drafted.</p><p style="background-color: #FF00FF">Further, any justification based on competency is untenable.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The actual requirements of s. 30 and the regional quotas have little if anything to do with the professional competence of workers in the construction industry.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">This was noted by Judge Bonin who stated that “[t]he certificate’s main purpose was to maintain hiring priority”.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">Being a resident of Quebec in the previous year, having worked a set number of hours in that year, and being less than 50 years old, do not verify competence.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The same may be said for the regional quotas and control over regional mobility within the province.</p><p style="background-color: #FF00FF">As such, I find there is no rational connection between the objective and the measures taken.</p><p style="background-color: #FF00FF">48                               Minimal impairment is also an important consideration in this case.</p><p style="background-color: #00FF00">Despite any public interest objective that may be said to exist, this Court must still consider if the individual worker is minimally affected by the obligation to join one of five specific associations and the additional requirements which must be met in order to join these associations.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">Trudel J. stated that if there was an infringement of s. 2(d), any restriction is minimal; but she does not explain this finding beyond stating that every employee is free to choose which association he or she must join and affirming that the potential worker may also voice his or her dissent at all union meetings or votes without sanction (pp.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">930-31).</p><p style="background-color: #FF00FF">She does not discuss the fundamental importance of ideological conformity as described in these reasons.</p><p style="background-color: #00FFFF">She did not discuss the specific provisions in s. 30, nor the Regulations.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">Her view seems to be that the “competency” requirements per se are not related to freedom of association.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">I disagree.</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">In this case, they are related to freedom of association because one must meet these requirements to join the union (s. 32).</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">In my view, any justification must deal with the terms of the regime and its effects.</p><p style="background-color: #00FF00">The mis en cause must show that the actual scheme is justified as a fair limitation on the Charter right affected.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">49                               If one views the purpose of the legislation as ensuring the competency of construction workers, neither the limitation of the “freedom to associate” nor the limitation of the “freedom from association” are minimally impairing.</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">As discussed above, s. 30 and the regional quotas have little or nothing at all to do with competence and, as such, they certainly cannot be viewed as minimal impairments of s. 2(d).</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">50                               Further, when considering the public interest nature of collective bargaining, I fail to see how s. 30 and the regional quotas minimally impair the positive and negative components of the freedom of association.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">While recognizing the importance of collective bargaining in the public interest, if this was in fact the objective of these provisions, there is no evidence that it need result in government control over admission to the work force based on the factors discussed above or result in a denial of the democratic principle.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">As was shown by the factual situation in Lavigne, there are other choices that a government can make which support collective bargaining.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The imposition of a Rand formula, for instance, would allow for collective bargaining to continue without the requirement that workers actually join a union.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Furthermore, with respect to a means to protect the negative right, had there been no problem with the positive right in this case, the government could possibly have instituted a clause allowing those who did not wish to join a union to simply abstain while continuing to pay union dues to the representative union in the majority or to a collective ‘pot’ to be divided equally among all five representative unions.</p><p style="background-color: #FF00FF">51                               Given the above conclusions, it is unnecessary to consider the deleterious effects of the measures chosen.</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">52                               I would allow the appeal with costs, strike down ss.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">30 and 32 of the Act and s. 23 of the Regulation respecting the election of a representative association by the employees of the construction industry, and suspend the declaration of invalidity for 18 months to permit the legislature to consider amendments to its legislation.</p><p style="background-color: #F5FFFA">The following are the reasons delivered by   53                               L’Heureux-Dubé J.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">-- In this appeal, the appellants challenge the constitutionality of the legislation which governs labour relations in the construction industry in Quebec, the Act Respecting Labour Relations, Vocational Training and Manpower Management in the Construction Industry, R.S.Q., c.

Rev.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">In order to maintain exhaustiveness, such matters fall under the general residual power of Parliament by virtue of their distinctiveness from matters under provincial jurisdiction and their indivisibility between various heads of jurisdiction.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">But when the national concern doctrine is improperly applied, POGG ceases to be residual in nature.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">When that is so, it can become an instrument to enhance federal and correspondingly decrease provincial authority.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Courts must be careful in recognizing matters of national concern, because the national concern branch has great potential to upset the division of powers.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Once a matter is qualified as of national concern, Parliament has exclusive jurisdiction over the matter, including its intra-provincial aspects.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Thus, an expansive interpretation of the doctrine can threaten the fundamental structure of federalism and unduly restrain provincial legislature’s law-making authority.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">It would allow Parliament to acquire exclusive jurisdiction over matters that fall squarely within provincial jurisdiction and flatten regional differences.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Courts should never start a division of powers analysis by looking to the federal residual power.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">To preserve the federal balance, courts should treat POGG as a power of last resort.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The scope of the national concern doctrine must be limited to matters that cannot fall under other heads of jurisdiction and that cannot be distributed among multiple heads, thus filling a constitutional gap.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Accordingly, the doctrine only applies to matters which are truly of national concern, as opposed to matters of a merely local or private nature that fall under s. 92(16).</p><p style="background-color: #00FFFF">The national concern doctrine applies when two conditions are met: first, the matter does not fall within (i.e., it is distinct from) the enumerated heads of jurisdiction and, second, it is single and indivisible.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The requirements of singleness, distinctiveness and indivisibility serve the purpose of identifying matters that are truly residual in two ways.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The matter must be distinct from provincial matters and must be incapable of division between both orders of government such that it must be entrusted solely to Parliament.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">These requirements give effect to the general residual power of Parliament under POGG and ensure that there is no jurisdictional gap in the division of powers.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">They apply to both new matters and to matters which, although originally falling under provincial jurisdiction, have come to extend beyond the powers of the province and, due to indivisibility, must be entrusted exclusively to Parliament.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Given the residual nature of POGG, the importance of a matter has nothing to do with whether it is a matter of national concern.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The role of the general residual power is to maintain the exhaustiveness of the division of powers, not to centralize important matters that can be legislated upon by the provinces or by both orders of government.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">First, the impugned matter must be distinct from matters falling under the enumerated heads of s. 92.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">This will be met when the matter is beyond provincial reach, including because of the limitation of provincial jurisdiction to matters in the province.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">This inquiry includes consideration of the provincial residuum: if the matter is of a merely local or private nature, it would fall under s. 92(16).</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The matter must also be distinct from matters falling under federal jurisdiction, as POGG is purely residual.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Second, even if the matter does not come within an enumerated head of power, it must be single and indivisible to fall under POGG rather than an aggregate that can be broken down and distributed to enumerated heads of jurisdiction.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The fact that provinces are unable to deal with a matter is insufficient to conclude that it falls under POGG.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The nature of the matter must be such that it cannot be shared between both orders of government and that it must be entrusted to Parliament, exclusively, to avoid a jurisdictional vacuum.</p><p style="background-color: #00FF00">In evaluating whether the matter has a singleness, distinctiveness and indivisibility, it is relevant to consider what is known as the provincial inability test, that is, what would be the effect on extra-provincial interests of a provincial failure to deal effectively with the control or regulation of the intra-provincial aspect of the matter.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The provincial inability inquiry has been designed to control the centralization of powers and to limit the extension of the national concern doctrine to matters that are beyond the power of the provinces to deal with and that must be legislated upon by Parliament, exclusively.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Extra-provincial effects, on their own, are insufficient to satisfy the provincial inability test.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Rather, the extra-provincial effects must be such that the matter, or part of the matter, is beyond the powers of the provinces to deal with on their own or in tandem.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">If the pith and substance of provincial legislation comes within the classes of subjects assigned to the provinces, incidental or ancillary extra-provincial effects are irrelevant to its validity.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Evidence that provinces are not cooperating, even combined with the presence of extra-provincial effects, is also insufficient to make out provincial inability.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Provinces are sovereign within their sphere of jurisdiction and can legitimately choose different policies than other provinces.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Further, provincial inability is no more than an indicium of singleness, distinctiveness and indivisibility.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">In line with the residual role of POGG, federal authority over what was formerly within provincial competence is only justified where a matter has become distinct from what the provinces can do, and cannot be shared between orders of government because of its indivisibility.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">In such a case, reliance on POGG is the only way to maintain the exhaustiveness of the division of powers.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Otherwise, there would be a jurisdictional void — if the federal Parliament did not have jurisdiction over such a matter, no one would.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">When determining if a matter can pass muster as a subject matter falling under POGG, the final consideration is whether it has a scale of impact on provincial jurisdiction that is reconcilable with the fundamental distribution of legislative power under the Constitution.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The evaluation of the scale of impact on the federal balance illustrates the need for caution when determining whether a new permanent head of exclusive power should, in effect, be added to the federal list of powers.</p><p style="background-color: #00FF00">This prong of the test requires courts to determine whether recognizing the proposed new federal power would be compatible with the federal structure.</p><p style="background-color: #00FF00">It does not ask whether the importance of the proposed new federal power outweighs the infringement on provincial jurisdiction.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">3, and there are already proposals in Canada of ways to mitigate these inevitable floodgate problems: see B. Etherington, “Freedom of Association and Compulsory Union Dues: Towards a Purposive Conception of a Freedom to not Associate” (1987), 19 Ottawa L. Rev.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">1.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">My colleague LeBel J.’s discussion in the present case is a good illustration of the difficulties of trying to circumscribe such an alleged right (in particular at paras.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">215-32) which Iacobucci J. underlines (para.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">284).</p><p style="background-color: #00FFFF">59                               Although I agree that no one should be forced to associate, contrary to my colleague LeBel J. I am of the view that s. 2(d) of the Charter does not offer such constitutional protection for the reasons I articulated.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">Rather, and particularly on the narrowly circumscribed definition of that right and numerous built-in exceptions which my colleague LeBel J. adopts, the constitutional guarantee of freedom of expression under s. 2(b) will come into play if and when one is forced to associate as well as possibly s. 7 of the Charter.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">There is no need to create a “right not to associate” as a component of s. 2(d) of the Charter with all the consequences which might ensue and a protected right which, in my view, is not contemplated by s. 2(d).</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">60                               The real concern expressed by McLachlin J. in Lavigne regarding “freedom from coerced ideological conformity” can be addressed without creating a protected “right not to associate”, as Wilson J. pointed out in Lavigne: “To hold that s. 2(d) does not include the right not to associate does not leave those who do not wish to associate without redress for these harms.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">Sections 2(b) and 7 of the Charter, in particular, would seem to me to be available in appropriate cases” (p. 263).</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">61                               I am also mindful of Dickson J.’s words in R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., 1985 CanLII 69 (SCC), [1985] 1 S.C.R.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">295, at p. 344, referred to by Wilson J. in Lavigne, at p. 259, that extending the protected right to freedom of association to include a freedom not to associate would be “to overshoot the actual purpose of the right or freedom in question”.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">As mentioned by Wilson J., at p. 259:   Mr. Goudge argued that to include a negative freedom of association within the compass of s. 2(d) would set the scene for contests between the positive associational rights of union members and the negative associational rights of non‐members.</p><p style="background-color: #FF00FF">To construe the section in this way would place the Court in the impossible position of having to choose whose s. 2(d) rights should prevail.</p><p style="background-color: #00FFFF">I agree with counsel for the respondent that an interpretation leading to such a result should be avoided if at all possible.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">The Fundamental Purpose of Freedom of Association   62                               In Reference re Public Service Employee Relations Act (Alta.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">), 1987 CanLII 88 (SCC), [1987] 1 S.C.R.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">313 (the “Alberta Reference”), McIntyre J., for the majority,  stated at p. 408, that the “fundamental purpose of freedom of association .</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">. . [is] to permit the collective pursuit of common goals”.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">In Lavigne, supra, Wilson J., at p. 252, reviewed the analysis on freedom of association in the Alberta Reference and concluded that:   [I]n construing the purpose behind s. 2(d) this Court was unanimous in finding that freedom of association is meant to protect the collective pursuit of common goals.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">This reading of the purpose behind the guarantee of freedom of association has been confirmed in more recent cases.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">For instance, s. 2(d) was considered again in the labour relations context in Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada v. Northwest Territories (Commissioner), 1990 CanLII 72 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">367 (“P.I.P.S.”).</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">63                               In Lavigne, La Forest J., at p. 317, introduced the term “individual aspirations” when he noted that “[i]t is important to recognize that while it is true, as Wilson J. states in her reasons, at p. 251, that ‘freedom of association is meant to protect the collective pursuit of common goals’, such protection is afforded ultimately to further individual aspirations”.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">64                               I interpret the meaning of “individual aspirations” as being a set which includes a subset under the rubric of “common goals” as well as a subset comprising “individual goals”.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">In the context of freedom of association, I view La Forest J.’s “individual aspirations” as referring primarily to the subset of common goals.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The pursuit of individual  aspirations comprises both the pursuit of individual goals and the  pursuit of common goals.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">The freedom to associate protects the giving effect to the latter.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">While it could be the case that in a given case only common goals are involved, the inclusion of individual goals within the term “individual aspirations” does not negate the argument.</p><p style="background-color: #00FFFF">65                               I believe that it would not correspond with this Court’s jurisprudence to characterize the purpose of s. 2(d) as meaning solely the protection of the common pursuit of individual goals, i.e.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">with no common goals in the equation.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">66                               There is an additional reason why the “common pursuit of individual goals” is not appropriate in the context of freedom of association analysis.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">In society, there is an element of synergy when individuals interact.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The mere addition of individual goals will not suffice.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">Society is more then the sum of its parts.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Put another way, a row of taxis do not a bus make.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">An arithmetic approach to Charter rights fails to encompass the aspirations imbedded in it.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">67                               In this context, negative rights are viewed as individual rights embodying individual goals: an individual is given the constitutional right not to belong to an association.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">But, if the “fundamental purpose of freedom of association, .</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">. . [is] to permit the collective pursuit of common goals”, then the very concept of a “negative freedom of association” becomes suspect.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">At issue is the definition of “common goals”.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">In such a context, the “collective pursuit of common goals” leads to an abstraction which is difficult to justify.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">68                               The references to American jurisprudence, also relied on by the appellant in Lavigne, as well as to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, 213 U.N.T.S.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">221, quoted by my colleagues, are subject to the following caveat expressed by Wilson J. in Lavigne, at pp.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">256-58:   [T]his Court must exercise caution in adopting any decision, however compelling, of a foreign jurisdiction.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">This Court has consistently stated that even although it may undoubtedly benefit from the experience of American and other courts in adjudicating constitutional issues, it is by no means bound by that experience or the jurisprudence it generated.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">The uniqueness of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms flows not only from the distinctive structure of the Charter as compared to the American Bill of Rights but also from the special features of the Canadian cultural, historical, social and political tradition. . . .</p><p style="background-color: #00FFFF">These observations are particularly apposite in this appeal since, as regards freedom of association, our Charter stands in marked contrast to the American Bill of Rights.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">A freedom to associate is not explicitly recognized in the Constitution of the United States.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">Protection of this freedom has been made possible only through its judicial recognition as a derivative of the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of speech. . . .</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">Under the Charter, in contrast, there is no necessary connection between association and speech in order to engage s. 2(d).</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">This distinction was noted by Dickson C.J.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">in the Alberta Reference.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">69                               On this point, as stated by Professor P. W. Hogg in Constitutional Law of Canada (loose-leaf ed.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">), vol.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">2, at p. 56‐18.2:   A case that is properly before a court may be capable of decision on a non‐constitutional ground or a constitutional ground or both.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The course of judicial restraint is to decide the case on the non‐constitutional ground.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">That way, the dispute between the litigants is resolved, but the impact of a constitutional decision on the powers of the legislative or executive branches of government is avoided.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">70                               The course of judicial restraint suggests that no new constitutional doctrine should be developed if existing doctrine could resolve the issue.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">In this regard, I would make a comment on the case of Sigurjónsson v. Iceland, Eur.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">264, cited by LeBel J. in his reasons at para.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">250, where he stated that in Sigurjónsson, the  European Court of Human Rights (“ECHR”) “clearly accepted that a right not to associate should be read into the guarantee of art.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">11(1)”.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">At p. 17, the majority of the ECHR stated:   .</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">. . Sigurjónsson objected to being a member of the association in question partly because he disagreed with its policy in favour of limiting the number of taxicabs and, thus, access to the occupation; in his opinion the interests of his country were better served by extensive personal freedoms, including freedom of occupation, than State regulation.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">Therefore, the Court is of the view that Article 11 can, in the circumstances, be considered in the light of Articles 9 and 10, the protection of personal opinion being also one of the purposes of the freedom of association guaranteed by Article 11 (see the above-mentioned Young, James and Webster judgment, pp.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">23-24, § 57).</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">The pressure exerted on the applicant in order to compel him to remain a member of Frami contrary to his wishes was a further aspect going to the very essence of an Article 11 right; there was an interference too in this respect.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">[Emphasis added.]</p><p style="background-color: #FF00FF">71                               It is apparent that the ECHR reached its conclusion by considering Mr. Sigurjónsson’s individual goals in the context of art.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">11 of the European Convention.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">The ECHR also held unanimously that it was “not necessary also to examine the case under Articles 9 or 10” (p. 20).</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">72                               Similarly, in another case cited by LeBel J. at para.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">250, Chassagnou and Others v. France [GD], Nos.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">25088/94, 28331/95 and 28443/95, ECHR 1999-III, the ECHR applied a hybrid analysis, a methodology which would not be required in Canada.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">In that case, all the applicants were owners of small landholdings.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">By law, the applicants, who are opposed to hunting, had to become members of the approved municipal or intermunicipality hunters’ associations set up in their municipalities and to transfer hunting rights over their land to these associations so that all hunters living in the relevant municipality could hunt there.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">The ECHR stated (at para.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">117):   To compel a person by law to join an association such that it is fundamentally contrary to his own convictions to be a member of it, and to oblige him, on account of his membership of that association, to transfer his rights over the land he owns so that the association in question can attain objectives of which he disapproves, goes beyond what is necessary to ensure that a fair balance is struck between conflicting interests and cannot be considered proportionate to the aim pursued.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">There has therefore been a violation of Article 11.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">73                               My opposition to the enshrinement of the negative right of association in s. 2(d) is not based on a desire to curtail the rights of those who feel aggrieved by the exclusion of the negative right of association.</p><p style="background-color: #00FFFF">My argument has to do with my belief that we have the constitutional tools to deal with such a grievance.</p><p style="background-color: #00FFFF">74                               As discussed above, the analysis followed in Sigurjónsson would be contrary to our jurisprudence for two reasons.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">First, it grounded its analysis primarily on individual goals, giving far lesser weight to communal goals.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Secondly, a solution could have been found under arts.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">9 or 10, but the ECHR decided otherwise.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">75                               This judicial parsimony should be ascribed to prudence, not miserliness.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Constitutional remedies are powerful tools which ought to be used with prudence.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">When required, however, they should be applied with vigour and in a purposive manner.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">76                               An additional reason for caution is based on the fact that the impetus for efforts to establish the negative right to association has historically originated with those opposed to the establishment or maintenance of labour associations.</p><p style="background-color: #00FF00">Such a tainted pedigree raises the question of whether we should constitutionalize an initiative whose purpose was to defeat the right to associate.</p><p style="background-color: #00FFFF">This concern is reflected in the dissenting opinion of Judge Thór Vilhjálmsson in the Sigurjónsson case, where he comments (at p. 21):   The present case shows, in my opinion, that the classic freedom of association, which is expressly guaranteed in Article 11 of the Convention, is essentially different from the negative freedom of association.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">The freedom guaranteed by the Convention was originally one of the foundations of political freedom and activity.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Since then, under the protection of this freedom, the trade unions, and their activities aimed at improving the lot of their members, have developed.</p><p style="background-color: #00FFFF">The Icelandic case before the Court now shows that in certain circumstances it is not clear whether the negative freedom of association is likely to further the interests of those concerned in a way comparable to the clear benefits of the classic freedom.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">77                               The creation and application of new judicial tools, featuring a questionable mark of origin, will inevitably generate new jurisprudence to which there are certain risks attached.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Such a development may not be viewed as prudent, especially in light of the fact that there is no need to take such a risk because proven alternatives are available.</p><p style="background-color: #00FFFF">78                               In any event the European Convention cannot dictate the way the Canadian Charter does protect fundamental rights and as my colleague LeBel J. asserts (at para.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">251) “the consideration of European jurisprudence is not determinative”.</p><p style="background-color: #00FFFF">I do not however agree with his assertion that “it confirms an interpretation whereby a limited right to refuse to associate should be read into s. 2(d) of the Charter”.</p><p style="background-color: #00FFFF">In my view such a reading of s. 2(d) of the Charter is in no way implied in the European jurisprudence, since it is as compatible with my position that, if such a right exists, it is protected by s. 2(b) of the Charter.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">79                               Here, there is no negation of the right not to associate but only the way in which the Canadian Charter protects it.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">For these reasons, more extensively discussed in the reasons of Wilson J. in Lavigne, to which I refer as if herein recited at length, I conclude “that s. 2(d) includes only the positive freedom to associate” in the words of Wilson J.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">(p. 263).</p><p style="background-color: #FF00FF">This being said, there is no reason for me to embark on a s. 1 analysis.</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">80                               In conclusion, I agree with LeBel J. that the constitutional question should be answered in the negative and that the appeal should be dismissed.</p><p style="background-color: #00FFFF">81                               I would like, however, to add the following comment about the reality faced by Quebec workers in the construction industry, which underlies the constitutional challenge under s. 2(d) of the Charter in this case.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">82                               Under s. 39 of the Act, as it was drafted at the time the appellants were charged with infractions under the Act, no employer could employ a worker in the Quebec construction industry unless such worker had previously obtained from the Commission de la construction du Quebec a card indicating his or her choice of a representative association among the five unions accredited to represent construction workers.</p><p style="background-color: #00FF00">Under s. 36, that card was to be issued only to the workers on a list of all employees who had fulfilled the requirements set out in s. 30 of the Act, namely:   (a)  holding a journeyman competency certificate, an occupation competency certificate or an apprentice competency certificate issued by the Commission;   (b)  having worked at least three hundred hours during the first twelve of the fifteen complete calendar months preceding the month during which the poll provided for in section 32 is held; and   (c)  domiciled in Quebec on the last day of the thirteenth month preceding the original </p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">83                               Only after having fulfilled all these requirements would a construction worker be allowed to choose a representative association, after being placed on the list.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">However, fulfilling the requirement of 300 working hours would not be possible since an employee was prohibited from working those 300 hours because s. 39 of the Act prohibits an employer from hiring a worker who does not have a card.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">This is the conundrum which the construction workers in Quebec were facing at the time.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">84                               However, the Act appears to have been subsequently modified, in part by the addition of a new s. 36.1 (S.Q.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">1996, c. 74, s. 36):  “The Commission may, at any time, issue a card under section 36 to a person who wishes to begin working as an employee in the construction industry and who makes known to the Commission, according to the procedure established by regulation of the Commission, his election respecting one of the associations whose name has been published pursuant to section 29” (emphasis added).</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">85                               This question of statutory interpretation of the Act not being before us, I leave it at that.</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">86                               I would dismiss the appeal.</p><p style="background-color: #F5FFFA">The judgment of Gonthier, Arbour and LeBel JJ.</p><p style="background-color: #F5FFFA">was delivered by   LeBel J.</p><p style="background-color: #F5FFFA">–   I.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">Introduction       87                               Labour relations in the Quebec construction industry have gone through a long, complex and difficult history.</p><p style="background-color: #FF00FF">The present appeal is a new episode of this history.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">Advance Cutting & Coring Ltd., a construction contractor active in the Ottawa Valley, and the other appellants, who are contractors, real estate promoters or construction workers, want to write a new chapter, in order, in their view, to protect  the freedom of association of workers in the construction industry.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">In the process, they want to be acquitted of charges that they hired employees who did not have the required competency certificates to work on a construction project, contrary to the provisions of the Act Respecting Labour Relations, Vocational Training and Manpower Management in the Construction Industry, R.S.Q., c. R-20 (the “Construction Act”) or that they worked in the industry without the proper competency certificates.</p><p style="background-color: #FF00FF">Needless to say, the respondent and the mis en cause and some of the interveners disagree strongly about the contents and direction of this new chapter.</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">They ask that the appeal be dismissed.</p><p style="background-color: #FF00FF">They even dispute the standing of the appellants to raise the constitutional arguments advanced in this case.</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">For the reasons set out below, even though I accept that the appellants have the standing to raise the constitutional issue, I propose that the appeal be dismissed.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">In the process of reaching this conclusion, the opportunity has arisen to re-examine this Court’s decision in Lavigne v. Ontario Public Service Employees Union, 1991 CanLII 68 (SCC), [1991] 2 S.C.R.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">211.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">As a result, I intend to propose a refined view of the right not to associate protected under s. 2(d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and to lay out the limits of that right, in relation to the correlative positive freedom to associate also protected by s. 2(d) of the Charter.</p><p style="background-color: #F5FFFA">II.</p><p style="background-color: #FF00FF">The Issues and Their Background   88                               A word of caution is required at the outset of these reasons.</p><p style="background-color: #00FF00">89                               This appeal has nothing to do with mobility rights protected under s. 6 of the Charter and the impact they might have on the validity of the legislative provisions challenged by the appellants.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The constitutional questions defined by then Chief Justice Lamer were limited to the issue of freedom of association under s. 2(d) of the Charter.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">The arguments in the courts below were almost exclusively concerned with the guarantee of freedom of association.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">Moreover, during the hearing, members of the Court put very specific questions to counsel for the appellants about whether s. 6 of the Charter was engaged.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">Counsel answered that the only constitutional question at issue here was freedom of association.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">90                               Any consideration of the question of mobility rights would also be unfair to the respondent and the mis en cause and the interveners supporting them, because the legal and factual issues have been framed in the courts below and in this Court in relation to the guarantee of freedom of association, its interpretation and the application of the relevant provisions of the Construction Act.</p><p style="background-color: #FF00FF">No further discussion of s. 6 would thus be justified in this appeal, other than to address issues raised in the accompanying reasons, written by Bastarache J.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">91                               The issue of an alleged breach of the guarantee of freedom of association by the provisions of the Construction Act relating to union membership was raised by Advance Cutting & Coring Ltd. and the other appellants in the construction industry as an answer to charges laid under s. 119.1 of the Construction Act.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">Advance Cutting and the other appellants face various charges of having hired and used workers who did not have the competency certificates required under the Construction Act, contrary to s. 119.1.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">Some appellants who are construction workers stand charged with having performed construction work within the meaning of the Act without holding the required competency certificates, also under s. 119.1.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">92                               The appellants did not dispute the facts.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">They conceded  that they had used unqualified personnel on construction work, which was subject to the Act, or in the case of the workers themselves, that they had not obtained the necessary work permits and vocational certifications, before going to work.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">93                               They asserted that workers could not obtain competency certificates without becoming members of one of the union groups listed in s. 28 of the Construction Act.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">They claimed that this obligation was unconstitutional, because it breaches the right not to associate which, in

guarantee of freedom of association.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">It does not forbid the formation of other unions.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">It could be challenged successfully only if it were demonstrated that there exists a constitutional right to non-association.</p><p style="background-color: #BF40BF">Such a right not to associate would be inherently inconsistent with the practical exercise of the right to association and could deprive it of any real content and effect.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">If such a right were to be recognized, it should be strictly limited and defined as a right not to be compelled to adhere to some form of ideological conformity.</p><p style="background-color: #FFFF00">Finally, if there had been a breach

movement in Quebec.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">This history has also been influenced by the particular techniques used by the legislature to regulate labour relations, to establish and administer labour standards and to control the vocational  competency of the work force.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">No analysis of the Construction Act, as it stood when the present litigation began in 1992-1993, would be adequate without some examination of this historical background.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">118                           For a time, these techniques of labour relations management seemed to work well.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">As will be seen below,  a pattern of conflict between competing unions amidst  economic change in the industry led to a re-assessment of the structure and to a new determination in the 1960s and 1970s to restore peace and stability in the industry.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">119                           The first attempt at setting up standards of employment in the construction industry in Quebec dates back to 1934, when the provincial legislature adopted a law on  the “extension of collective labour agreements” (Collective Labour Agreements Extension Act, S.Q.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">1934, c. 56).</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The Act enabled the provincial government to give legal effect throughout a particular commercial, industrial or service activity to provisions of labour agreements entered into by representative labour and employer groups.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">The Department of Labour assessed the representativeness of those groups.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">Upon its recommendation, the government would then adopt an order in council or “décret” giving legal effect to provisions of the labour agreements concerning mainly wages and some benefits.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">Those standards would bind not only the parties to the labour agreements, but also all employers and employees covered by the professional and territorial jurisdiction of the decree.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">The decree would apply throughout the province, in a region or even in a particular area, in a defined industry or activity.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">(See J.-L. Dubé, Décrets et comités paritaires:  L’extension juridique des conventions collectives (1990), at pp.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">5 et seq.).</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">In this manner, this law attempted to stop a race to the bottom of labour conditions during the economic pressures of the Great Depression.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">The law passed after much supportive lobbying by labour groups especially the Catholic unions (CTCC) (Confédération des travailleurs catholiques du Canada) later to become the CSN (Confédération des syndicats nationaux) and with the support of some employer groups and in spite of the bitter opposition of others (see Dubé, supra, at pp.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">12-15).</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">120                           In the construction industry, the provincial government adopted a number of regional decrees to extend and enforce basic labour standards on wages, hours of work, and a few other benefits.</p><p style="background-color: #FFA500">However, no provisions concerning union security, like membership or collection of dues, could be included in those decrees.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">This system of regional construction decrees was renewed and kept in place until the 1960s.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">121                           In 1944, the Quebec legislature adopted the Labour Relations Act, R.S.Q.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">1941, c. 162A.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">This law provided for union certification and monopoly union representation within a defined bargaining unit, under the supervision of a labour relations board.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">With some modifications, it introduced a system of management of labour relations similar to the North American model arising out of the New Deal in the United States.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">After a number of amendments, it became the Quebec Labour Code in 1964 (S.Q.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">1963-64, c. 45 (now R.S.Q., c. C-27)).</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">122                           In Quebec, this system of local or defined bargaining units represented by an agent holding exclusive collective bargaining rights did not make any significant inroads into the construction industry.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">Even if construction workers fell within the scope of the Labour Relations Act and unions could have sought certification or voluntary recognition under the Act, labour relations in the construction industry remained regulated until the 1960s mainly through a number of regional decrees, which concerned the wages, benefits and classification of construction workers.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">123                           However, even in the early 1960s, the labour relations of the industry reflected the deep divisions existing within the Quebec labour movement.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">The most important and distinctive aspect of the Quebec labour relations scene had been the rise of a strong “homegrown” labour movement, strongly influenced at the time by the Catholic church.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">Those Catholic unions found themselves competing with other union groups that were already affiliated with international or Canada-wide organizations and which later came under the umbrella of the Quebec Federation of Labour (QFL) and the Canadian Labour Congress.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">124                           In the construction industry, international unions were particularly strong in mechanical crafts like electricity or plumbing, but also controlled important trades like iron work and elevator installation.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">Generally speaking, international unions controlled the construction industry in Montreal, where the Catholic unions remained weak for a long time.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">On the other hand, the “homegrown” unions were far more active and influential outside the Metropolitan Montreal area.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">In this manner, the construction industry mirrored the conflicts and divisions within the Quebec labour movement as a whole, according to the evidence given at trial by Réal Mireault, an expert on Quebec labour relations,  and for a time the Deputy Minister of Labour of the province.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">125                           Despite those divisions and latent conflicts, until the 1960s, the system of regional decrees and collective bargaining had nevertheless maintained basic labour standards in the construction industry and a degree of industrial peace (see Commission de la construction du Québec, Historique des relations du travail dans l’industrie de la construction au Québec (1990), at p. 3).</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">Indeed, there seem to have been fewer strikes or work stoppages in Quebec than in other provinces during that period.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">That peaceful, if somewhat hostile, co-existence between the separate strands of the Quebec labour movement broke down after 1965.</p><p style="background-color: #3CB371">Changes in the laws governing labour relations and in the economic life of the industry probably account for this breakdown.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">After the adoption of the Quebec Labour Code, which at the time applied to the construction industry, attempts at union certification for particular projects or employers took place.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">Such a pattern of local union organization and collective bargaining would have run at cross purposes with the regional system of decrees and informal collective bargaining that had generally prevailed until then.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">Those attempts at certification on a local basis generally came to nought in the construction industry.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">The Labour Relations Board managed neither to deal, in a timely manner, with the applications for certification nor to design a proper regulatory framework for such applications.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">Meanwhile, especially after the 1967 Montreal World’s Fair, construction work became scarcer in Montreal.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">Large industrial and natural resources projects were on the other hand being launched in several regions of the province of Quebec.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">International unions tried to move into the regions and to take control of these major projects.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">126                           More particularly, the international unions in the mechanical trades tried to secure a complete monopoly on all work in large-scale industrial projects throughout the province.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">On the other hand, the CSN -- Confédération des syndicats nationaux -- the former confederation of Catholic unions –  made new efforts to increase its  presence in Montreal and, without much success, to break into the specialized construction trades.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">Some union groups sought to gain exclusive bargaining rights for a particular project.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">Others tried to keep the regional system alive.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">In 1968, it had become evident that the traditional labour relations system in the industry was no longer working.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">The system of regional decrees was breaking down, while local certification under the Labour Code had proven practically unworkable.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">127                           Conflicts arose within union and employer groups.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">For example, at least half a dozen provincial, regional or trade groups competed for support among contractors.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">Violence frequently flared up at construction sites.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">Work stoppages broke out often and uncontrollably.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">Abuses like bribery or improper use of union placement systems were rife.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">Some new framework had to be designed and put in place.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">The attempts to fix or replace the old collective bargaining regime gave birth to the 1968 Act (Construction Industry Labour Relations Act, S.Q.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">1968, c. 45), which set up a specialized labour relations system, limited to the construction industry, where the Labour Code (R.S.Q.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">1964, c. 141 (now R.S.Q., c. C-27)) and the Collective Agreement Decrees Act (R.S.Q.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">1964, c. 143 (now R.S.Q., c. D-2)) no longer applied (ss.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">3 and 59 of the 1968 Act (now R.S.Q., c. R-20, ss.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">27 and 124)).</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">(See F. Morin and J.-Y.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">Brière, Le droit de l’emploi au Québec (1998), at pp.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">586-87.)</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">This reform of the old system, which itself had been unique to Quebec, created a new labour scheme also uniquely tailored to the Quebec construction industry.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">128                           The new regime created a negotiation system that included all construction trades and retained regional bargaining, but allowed for province-wide bargaining if the parties agreed (Historique des relations du travail dans l’industrie de la construction au Québec, supra, at pp.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">5-6).</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">The law recognized the CSN and the QFL as bargaining agents for their constituent unions and locals and granted the same status to six different employer groups in respect of their own members.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">A right of veto was granted to every representative union federation as well as to all employer groups.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">The collective agreement entered into between unions and employer associations would be extended by a decree, which would legally bind all employers and employees within a region or the province.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">The enforcement of labour standards was entrusted to joint committees made up of employer and union representatives.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">For the first time, the Act allowed the introduction into the collective agreement and decrees of provisions relating to union membership and dues.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">129                           The law was passed amid high hopes, but disappointment followed.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">Turmoil did not subside in the construction industry.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">The new collective bargaining system broke down  almost immediately.</p><p style="background-color: #EE4B2B">The same conflicts, strikes and violence continued in spite of several years of large- and small-scale modifications of the law which brought no immediate relief (see Historique des relations du travail dans l’industrie de la construction au Québec, supra, at pp.</p><p style="background-color: #00BFFF">9-15; R.
