# this me implementing a coding solving process
#for each of these problems
# describe all variabledsin problem and then steps to solution
# talk everything out and use the coding method you were developing
# need to still solve the thing related to course work
# quesiton i could ask= what else is invovled in the problem

# example of me working through a problem using reasoning 
# only can do this once i start having questions and infomation to load in
# so start editing and getting everyhting into the proper categories and create question tools etc
# to do this need to work with teh sql database
# need to make sure this sysyem work

# steps
# program goal is to 
#step 0 need to upload everything to python
#step 1 need to create table in database
# how to create tables in python
#step 2 need to make table accessible to program to add to it and have a input option
# step 3 need to find a smart way to input everything into the table such that they have categories and are searchable and accessible in a easy way
# maybe some sort of model is key, this is where the problem sovling strategy should probably come in
