The PSP search API is where all my work on everything and ideas are for new businesses
Coding 10 is where the newest version of the file is saved   on the ssd blue drive
This is the main function for my ideas and main code is under the function psp_search_function_api_functions
And under business methods there are different functions to use psp_search_function_api_functions  doc
add_strategy_test # this is the main one which is a separate doc
generate_dag_from_current_position_to_figure_out_best_actions_you_can_take_for_different_objectives# rank these life possible actions by looking at objectives
generate_all_life_possible_actions_and_effects_dic# this is to grab data off of wikipeida
