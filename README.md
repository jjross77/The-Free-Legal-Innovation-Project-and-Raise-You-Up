Under the PSP API folder are all of my different ideas stored as functions to still be built and added to the problem-solving program under file psp_search_function_api_functions.py.

The PSP API would generate all the documents you might need to fill out and create in your workflow and will also generate documents that are tangentially related to the task you are trying to solve, giving you a different way a task might be completed or a problem to be solved.

 The other part of the PSP API is that it would be able to tell you future actions you might wish to take based on your current positionality. The basic idea I had for this was looking at the stories of other people's lives on Wikipedia and then sorting these people to create a list of all relevant people on Wikipedia someone might look to decide on the next chapter of their life.  The program would suggest courses of action that you might wish to take, which are guided by objectives like helping the most people or making the most money. And using Wikipedia to accomplish the task.

The FLIP folder has a neural network to categorize sentences of law into the Fact, Issue, and Analysis groupings. You would run the neural network as an API and try to get other websites to use it as an API because it could help generate lists of issues an attorney might use to appeal a decision. It could be used to ensure you are really following the principle of "Stare Decisis" decisions and finding the precedents that best reflect your case because you could search the database for the closest matching factual sentences now that you have cateogrized them differently than other sentences in a legal decision.

The PSP API would work in the Django tailwind PSP website folder. The stack for the website is running nginx back end with DJANGO and tailwindcss.
